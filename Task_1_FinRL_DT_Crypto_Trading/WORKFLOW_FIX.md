# Workflow Fix - Dependency Checking

## Problem Fixed âœ…

The error occurred because `make convert-traj` was trying to run before the required RL training files were generated.

## Solution Applied

1. **Added dependency checking** to all workflow commands
2. **Fixed GPU ID parameters** (changed from -1 to 0)
3. **Added comprehensive dependency checker** (`make check-dependencies`)

## Updated Commands

### New Dependency Checker
```bash
make check-dependencies  # Check all workflow dependencies
```

### Fixed Commands
- `make convert-traj` - Now checks for RL training files before running
- `make train-factors` - Checks for Alpha101 factors
- `make train-dt` - Checks for trajectory data
- `make train-rl` - Uses correct GPU ID (0)
- `make train-ensemble` - Uses correct GPU ID (0)

## Correct Workflow Order

```bash
# Check current status
make check-dependencies

# Run complete workflow (recommended)
make workflow

# Or run step by step
make step1    # Generate Alpha101 factors
make step2    # Train RNN factor aggregation  
make step3    # Train single RL agent
make step4    # Train ensemble RL agents
make step5    # Convert RL trajectories
make step6    # Train Decision Transformer
make step7    # Evaluate Decision Transformer
```

## Error Prevention

The Makefile now prevents common errors by:
- âœ… Checking for required input files before each step
- âœ… Providing clear error messages with next steps
- âœ… Using correct parameters for all commands
- âœ… Validating workflow dependencies

## Testing

Test the fixes:
```bash
make check-dependencies  # Should show missing RL training
make convert-traj        # Should show helpful error message
make train-ensemble      # Run RL training first
make convert-traj        # Should work after RL training
```

The workflow is now robust and prevents dependency errors! ðŸš€
