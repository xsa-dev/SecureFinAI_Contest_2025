# Git Setup Instructions

## Problem Solved âœ…

The original issue was that large files (800MB+ CSV files, 14GB PyTorch files) were preventing git push to GitHub due to file size limits.

## Solution Applied

1. **Created a clean branch** without large file history
2. **Added comprehensive .gitignore** to exclude large files
3. **Removed large files** from git tracking
4. **Successfully pushed** the clean branch

## Current Status

- âœ… **Clean branch pushed**: `clean-branch`
- âœ… **Large files excluded**: All .npy, .pth, .csv files ignored
- âœ… **Ready for development**: No file size issues

## Next Steps

### Option 1: Use the Clean Branch (Recommended)
```bash
# Switch to the clean branch
git checkout clean-branch

# Continue development
make workflow
```

### Option 2: Replace the Original Branch
```bash
# Delete the old branch with large files
git branch -D feature/crypto-dt-enhanced-solution

# Rename clean branch to original name
git branch -m clean-branch feature/crypto-dt-enhanced-solution

# Push the renamed branch
git push origin feature/crypto-dt-enhanced-solution --force
```

### Option 3: Create Pull Request
1. Go to: https://github.com/xsa-dev/SecureFinAI_Contest_2025/pull/new/clean-branch
2. Create PR from `clean-branch` to `main`
3. Merge after review

## Files Excluded by .gitignore

The following file types are now automatically ignored:
- `*.npy` - NumPy arrays (data files)
- `*.pth` - PyTorch models
- `*.csv` - Large CSV datasets
- `offline_data_preparation/data/*` - All data files
- `offline_data_preparation/TradeSimulator-*/` - RL training outputs
- `trained_models/*.pth` - Trained model files
- `plots/` - Generated plots
- `.venv/` - Virtual environment

## Data Management

Large data files are now handled through:
1. **Automated download**: `make download-data`
2. **Local storage**: Files stay on your machine
3. **Not tracked by git**: Prevents repository bloat

## Benefits

- âœ… **Fast git operations**: No large file delays
- âœ… **Clean repository**: Only source code tracked
- âœ… **Easy collaboration**: Others can clone quickly
- âœ… **Automatic data handling**: Download when needed

## Verification

Check that everything works:
```bash
make status          # Check project status
make check-data      # Verify data integrity
make help            # See all available commands
```

The project is now ready for development without git issues! ðŸš€
