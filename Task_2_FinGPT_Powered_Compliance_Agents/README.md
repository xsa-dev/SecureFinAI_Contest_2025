## FinAI Contest Task 2 - FinGPT-Powered Compliance Agents

### 🧠 Task Overview

This task focuses on developing FinGPT agents for financial compliance and regulatory scenarios. Participants will build LLM-based agents capable of handling SEC filings analysis, regulatory compliance, sentiment analysis, antitrust reasoning, patent analysis, and financial audio processing. We encourage participants to use LoRA and reinforcement fine-tuning.

- **SEC Filings Analysis**: Analyze and extract insights from SEC filings, including XBRL data processing, financial statement Q&A, and mathematical reasoning.
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Handle real-time financial data retrieval, sentiment analysis, antitrust and copyright reasoning, patent and IP protection analysis.
- **Multimodal Processing**: Process various data types including text, structured data, and audio for comprehensive financial analysis.

#### 🎯 Objective

Your primary goal is to fine-tune or train a language model for financial compliance and regulatory tasks, covering SEC filings analysis, regulatory compliance, sentiment analysis, antitrust reasoning, patent analysis, and financial audio processing. You may also enhance your agent by integrating external tools, such as a retrieval-augmented knowledge base (RAG), to improve its analytical and question-answering capabilities.

#### 💡 What You Need To Do

1. **Collect and Prepare Your Raw Training Data**  
   Participants need to collect raw data given the sources provided below.

2. **Develop FinGPT Compliance Agents**  
   Use your collected data to fine-tune your own LLM for financial compliance and regulatory tasks. You can use FinGPT framework to fine-tune your model. We encourage participants to use LoRA and reinforcement fine-tuning. You can also enhance your agent by integrating external tools, such as RAG. You can view [**FinLoRA documentation**](https://finlora-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) to learn more about LoRA and some financial tasks.

3. **Submit Your Agent**  
   Submit your agent following the competition guidelines. Make sure your model is:

   - Capable of analyzing SEC filings and extracting structured information.
   - Proficient in regulatory compliance reasoning and analysis.
   - Robust in interpreting multimodal financial data and reasoning over it.

4. **Benchmarking Phase**  
   After submission, we will use our question sets to evaluate your model's performance across SEC filings analysis and regulatory compliance tasks.

### 📊 Question Set Overview

These question sets contain question-answer pairs collected and organized for evaluating model capabilities across SEC filings analysis and regulatory compliance tasks. These question sets are sampled from the test split of the datasets, which are used to benchmark your agent's performance. You **SHOULD NOT** use it or the entire test split for fine-tuning or training.

### 📁 Data Sources and Collection

#### 📥 1. SEC Filings Data

You can manually retrieve XBRL filings for individual companies via the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC):

1. Visit the [SEC EDGAR Company Search](https://www.sec.gov/edgar/searchedgar/companysearch).
2. Search by company name or ticker symbol.
3. Filter by filing types such as 10-K, 10-Q, etc.
4. Click on a specific filing.
5. Look for files with extensions like:
   - `.xml`
   - `.xsd`
   - `.xbrl`
   - or links labeled "Interactive Data".
6. Download the corresponding XBRL instance and taxonomy files.

> 💡 This method is ideal for collecting filings from specific companies or filing types in a controlled manner.

#### ⚙️ 2. XBRL Terminology & Standards

As a starting point, you may also use the provided web crawling script to automate the retrieval of XBRL-related documents from the [XBRL International Glossary](https://www.xbrl.org/guidance/xbrl-glossary/). This source provides standardized definitions and explanations of XBRL terms.

### 📊 Metrics

The model evaluation in each domain is the average score of all tasks.

#### 📘 Note for Participants

Participants are encouraged to use the above sources as a starting point to construct their own training/fine-tuning datasets. Your model's performance will strongly depend on the quality and comprehensiveness of your self-collected training data. These sources can help you build a rich and task-aligned dataset for model training, ensuring better performance on regulatory reasoning and question answering.

To ensure fair comparison and practical deployment, it is recommended that the model size should not exceed 8B parameters.
