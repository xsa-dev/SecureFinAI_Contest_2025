Login Home > The Standard > How > Getting Started for Regulators Regulators collect significant quantities of data from businesses in order to carry out their regulatory obligations. Right around the world, regulators are using the XBRL standard in order to improve reporting. The standard provides a well defined mechanism to: provide end-to-end integrity, with system-to-system connections, or alternatively form/template based assistance, to simplify and lower the costs associated with compliance. Equally and very typically, regulators can offer both choices, depending on the sophistication of the regulated entity. provide pre-defined public sets of business and accounting logic rules that must be passed prior to accepting filings, increasing the quality and consistency of filed data. provide pre-defined private sets of rules to help detect anomalies early and allow resources to be assigned to high priority entities. provide multi-lingual data input channels and mechanisms for multi-lingual republication of reports and forms, simplifying the accessibility of data where that is a goal. provide filer-centric and analyst-centric mechanisms for displaying reports. deal with complex multi-dimensional data, including via presentation templates and forms, as well as well defined semantics. natively deal with accounting, monetary and boolean types of information. store and transform the data into existing or COTS business intelligence systems where that is a goal. rapidly and accurately republish data for system-to-system ingestion and analysis. The Standard has been developed over many years, is freely available and is supported by a large and active public-private and not-for-profit consortium that is focussed on improving reporting in the public good. A very significant amount of specialised XBRL software exists to help regulators simplify their reporting implementations. Support for companies that need to comply with XBRL reporting requirements is very widespread across commercial accounting, ERP and regulatory reporting systems, simplifying the process of enabling the relevant reporting ecosystem. In addition, key “taxonomies” or definitions of reporting terms have been developed over many years, greatly simplifying the process of collecting data for a range of environments including IFRS and major risk based frameworks such as the European CRD IV implementation of Basel III. Joining the consortium is the best place for most regulators and government agencies to start, as it ensures access to peers and experts in the field and avoids “reinventing wheels” unnecessarily. Assuming, that important step is underway, what are some of the key things that regulators need to consider as they start to plan their data modernisation? Being clear about purpose There are many variables associated with these types of collections including – Republication Some, like tax authorities, never make the information they collect public. Others, like financial services regulators, make a subset of what they collect public. Still others, like securities regulators, stock exchanges and business registrars make everything they collect public. Different types of collections Some regulators collect information that must conform to specific regulatory definitions, without any flexibility, so as to maximise the analytic utility of the information and reduce the scope for interpretation. In XBRL terms this is called Closed Reporting. It can cover relatively straightforward data, such as summarised financial condition reports, but it can also cover much more complex types of reporting, such as multidimensional reporting of financial risks by bank and insurance regulators. Some regulators collect financial statements and other kinds of free format reports either for compliance reasons or for market transparency reasons. When collecting these reports in XBRL format, regulators have a choice about whether to collect, in structured form, the entire report, including company-specific terms and reporting choices, or a subset of the report, in normalised or summary view. Where company-specific terms are sought, this is called Open Reporting. Different goals Some regulatory reporting is aimed at improving the data that is available to regulators themselves, for analysis and review. Some regulatory reporting is aimed at third parties, either a broad market or a specific set of external stakeholders, for transparency, investment or regional or international reporting reasons. Whatever the purpose, or combination of purposes that the regulator might have, it is important to clearly define the goals at the outset of any effort to modernise with XBRL. The standard provides a very significant number of powerful capabilities and it is important to choose the most appropriate parts of the standard, with the end goals very clearly articulated. Levels of Comparability When designing XBRL based data collections, it is important that regulators decide (and preferably articulate) their goals in terms of data comparability. For some agencies, collecting data that aids comparability across companies will be a key consideration. For others, allowing companies to provide filings that exactly match their accounting disclosures is a key objective, either to facilitate sophisticated market-based analytics, or to enable regulatory analysis of the compliance of those disclosures. Getting this question right, up front, is probably one of the most important questions regulators face in their XBRL implementations. There are no right or wrong answers, although increasingly, XBRL provides guidance to members. Reuse of Existing Definitions Another key consideration for many regulators is to determine whether or not it is possible to reuse (and if necessary extend) existing substantial reporting frameworks such as the IFRS taxonomy. Reusing taxonomies (the collection of concept definitions that go to make up a set of reporting requirements) enhances comparability, enhances software interoperability and can greatly simplify regulatory reporting projects. Sometimes it is essential. Sometimes it is possible. Sometimes it is impossible. Regulators need to make appropriate judgements. Respondent Burden Considerations Another key question for many regulators is the level of respondent burden that is being imposed. While many project leaders are familiar with balancing the competing pressures of time, quality, scope and cost, for regulators there is often a fifth component – the extent of regulatory burden being imposed. In other words, the cost and complexity associated with sourcing an preparing the information sought by regulators is one of the variables in their control. In some cases, the use of XBRL can greatly diminish the respondent burden, as accounting and reporting software are able to reuse information already available. In other cases the technology can’t assist at all, and this is purely a policy question. Regulators need to understand the business environment, the software ecosystem, and their regulatory responsibilities in order to make necessary decisions. Getting Started: a summary To summarise, amongst many other questions, regulators and government agencies that are seeking to modernise their reporting framework need to: Be clear about the goals and scope of their project Determine how the resulting data will be used Define up front the importance of data comparability Assess the extent to which existing data definitions (XBRL taxonomies such as IFRS ) can be reused Decide what their policies and processes are in relation to respondent burden The XBRL International consortium provides a range of guidance, formal and informal to regulators and their stakeholders and the best way to access this information, and minimise the risks associated with “reinventing wheels” is to join the consortium.

          "Regulators collect significant quantities of data from businesses in order to carry out their regulatory obligations. Right around the world, regulators are using the XBRL standard in order to improve reporting. The standard provides a well defined mechanism to:",
          "A very significant amount of specialised XBRL software exists to help regulators simplify their reporting implementations. Support for companies that need to comply with XBRL reporting requirements is very widespread across commercial accounting, ERP and regulatory reporting systems, simplifying the process of enabling the relevant reporting ecosystem.",
          "Whatever the purpose, or combination of purposes that the regulator might have, it is important to clearly define the goals at the outset of any effort to modernise with XBRL.",
          "When designing XBRL based data collections, it is important that regulators decide (and preferably articulate) their goals in terms of data comparability. For some agencies, collecting data that aids comparability across companies will be a key consideration. For others, allowing companies to provide filings that exactly match their accounting disclosures is a key objective, either to facilitate sophisticated market-based analytics, or to enable regulatory analysis of the compliance of those disclosures.",
          "Getting this question right, up front, is probably one of the most important questions regulators face in their XBRL implementations. There are no right or wrong answers, although increasingly, XBRL provides guidance to members.",
          "Another key question for many regulators is the level of respondent burden that is being imposed. While many project leaders are familiar with balancing the competing pressures of time, quality, scope and cost, for regulators there is often a fifth component – the extent of regulatory burden being imposed. In other words, the cost and complexity associated with sourcing an preparing the information sought by regulators is one of the variables in their control. In some cases, the use of XBRL can greatly diminish the respondent burden, as accounting and reporting software are able to reuse information already available. In other cases the technology can’t assist at all, and this is purely a policy question. Regulators need to understand the business environment, the software ecosystem, and their regulatory responsibilities in order to make necessary decisions.",

The sample above shows an income statement that has been tagged using iXBRL.  Click on the image to explore this statement using an interactive iXBRL viewer .  The sample shows how structured data can be included in an iXBRL report whilst retaining full control over the appearance of the statement (the sample is based on the income statement on page 240 of this PDF report). Exploring the tags in the sample above will reveal the names of the “concepts” against which the figures are tagged (e.g. “ifrs:Revenue”).  These are drawn from a dictionary of concepts, known as a taxonomy.  In this case, the sample is an IFRS report and so it has been tagged using the IFRS taxonomy, published by the IFRS Foundation . Report presentation As noted above, iXBRL allows preparers to retain full control over the presentation of their report.  This includes the use of graphics and photos, as demonstrated in Global Legal Entity Identifier Foundation’s 2018 Annual Report : Click on the image to explore the full sample in the interactive viewer . Entity-specific disclosures Different reporting entities (whether they are companies, organisations or government agencies) prepare different reports, in accordance with relevant accounting standards. Even within peer groups, Company A’s financial statements will be different to Company B’s, according to their communication needs. iXBRL provides a number of different mechanisms to allow this diversity, reflecting the variations that have always been present in financial statements. In the example below, an entity-specific taxonomy, known as an extension taxonomy, has been used to tag the specific operating segments included in the report. . Click on the image to explore the full sample using the interactive viewer . This sample also demonstrates how text disclosures can be tagged as well as the numerical figures. This is not the only way in which variations across different financial statements can be managed, and in early 2017, XBRL International will make some recommendations about the most appropriate ways that this can be managed. Beyond financial reports The use of iXBRL is not limited to company financial reports.  The benefits of combining human-readable and machine-readable information can assist many domains in making the transition away from inefficient manual processes.  The sample below shows a corporate action document, disclosing a dividend payment. Clicking on the image will allow you to explore the full sample .  You can clear more about the efforts to modernise corporate actions reporting on the XBRL US website. An open standard The final sample is shown in a different, more fully-featured iXBRL viewer, made available by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).  Consumers have a free choice of tools for consuming and analysing iXBRL reports, a key benefit of using an open standard. The SEC’s viewer enables some sophisticated searches to be performed, for example, using information in the taxonomy to search a company’s quarterly return to find disclosures relating to a particular accounting standard change, but even this is barely scratching the surface of what is possible using iXBRL data. Working with iXBRL data is not just about exploring reports using a web browser.  The samples linked to above are valid iXBRL reports that can be loaded into any compliant processor, and the data within them can be consumed by analytics engines, loaded into databases for querying, or processed into new reports.  All this can be done whilst retaining links back to the information as it was originally reported and presented. Who uses iXBRL? iXBRL is in use around the world: In the US, all companies must file iXBRL to the SEC, such as this 10-Q filing from Delta . In the UK, over two million companies file iXBRL each year to HMRC, the UK tax authority, and to Companies House, the business registrar. In Japan, o ver 9000 listed companies and investment funds use iXBRL to submit financial statements to the Japan Financial Services Agency (JFSA) In Denmark, t he Danish Business Registrar has collected over 100,000 iXBRL formatted financial statements for the purposes of registration and market information. ESMA, the European Securities and Markets Authority  obliges public companies that report in IFRS (the vast majority of EU financial statements) to use Inline XBRL as the standard behind ESEF, for mandatory IFRS based Annual Financial Statement filings of all public companies across Europe, for reporting periods commencing on or after 1 January 2021. For a a range of actual filings associated with the ESEF mandate, see our sub-site, https://filings.xbrl.org . What about Sustainability Data? Starting in 2023 and accelerating quickly across the world a wide range of securities regulators are obliging the use of XBRL in statutory sustainability disclosures. Early voluntary filings are beginning to become available. For example, here is an integrated financial statement and sustainability report prepared by Aviva, a UK insurance company. And here is an example set of analytics based on that single report. Specifications XBRL technical specifications can be found on our XBRL Specification sub-site .

Why? Because AI is a powerful engine, and high-quality XBRL data is the fuel it needs. Why XBRL matters more than ever Modern AI tools can do amazing things with unstructured data—but it’s risky. They rely on probabilistic methods and can misinterpret key facts, especially when encountering novel or nuanced information. The reality is that almost every corporate report does contain nuanced information unique to that company. When data and data definitions are already structured with XBRL, AI models can: Instantly identify concepts (like “Net Profit”, “Total Employees” or “Going Concern Note”) without guesswork. Compare figures across many reports in seconds. Deliver more accurate, consistent, and trustworthy insights. In short: AI needs a solid foundation of verified, machine-readable data to reach its true potential. The risk of unstructured data Relying on AI to “read” PDF or HTML documents is a gamble. Different AI models—or even different versions of the same model, or the same model given slightly different prompts —may interpret the same report differently. That leads to: Conflicting conclusions Hard-to-trace errors Additional risk for decision-makers When there’s no single, definitive version of the truth, uncertainty rises—and in corporate reporting, uncertainty can translate to costly mistakes. The value of digital, structured reporting 1. Clarity & comparability Each disclosure in XBRL is tied to a specific concept, ensuring everyone—from CFOs to regulators—understands exactly what it means. 2. Efficiency & cost savings Machine-readable tags accurately identify each fact. Automated data extraction speeds up analysis and reduces manual work. 3. Traceability & accountability Each fact is company-verified and fully traceable back to its source. It’s possible to drill down from any analytic or AI-generated summary straight to the precise information being relied on. 4. Future-proof insights In an evolving AI landscape, training models on structured data protects against misinterpretation. As AI gets smarter, XBRL ensures it has the best possible starting point. Creating high-quality digital data, faster AI doesn’t just use structured data; it can also help create it. AI-driven tagging tools are making it simpler and more cost-effective for companies to prepare XBRL filings: Automated tag suggestions : AI proposes the right tag for each disclosure. Human oversight : People confirm the final choices, focusing in on the most challenging and complex areas, ensuring accuracy and compliance. This partnership between humans and AI will lead to streamlined workflows, so companies can publish high-quality, authoritative digital reports faster than ever. A powerful combination for business outcomes Rapid insights : Automated collation and comparison of data from multiple companies or time periods. Early risk detection : Users can quickly flag anomalies or emerging trends. Transparency for investors : Trust is built when anyone can trace an AI conclusion to a digitally signed, company-verified data point. Lower costs, less manual work : Data flows directly from companies to regulators, analysts, and investors, cutting out tedious and inaccurate re-keying or manual review of machine interpretations. Bottom line: In an AI-driven future, the best analysis starts with structured data . The road ahead Breakthroughs in AI are coming fast, opening new horizons for the ways in which we create, consume, and understand corporate reports. XBRL remains the gold standard for ensuring that everyone—machines and people alike—can access, compare, and trust the core facts. If AI is the self-driving car, XBRL is the well-built road network that allows it to travel safely and efficiently. In an age of extraordinary technology, XBRL is more indispensable than ever.

The National Securities and Stock Market Commission of Ukraine (NSSMC) has ruled that submissions must go through the Financial Reporting Collection Centre, ending the use of XML and cementing XBRL as the country’s sole format. This is a big step. It marks the full-scale move to structured, machine-readable reporting in Ukraine, sweeping away legacy formats and placing XBRL at the heart of financial oversight. The decision gives regulators a single, consistent stream of high-quality data, while companies now have a clear direction of travel: prepare, tag and file in XBRL, or risk being left behind. The reform also clears up previous ambiguities about when and how financial statements should be filed with the Commission. Under Ukraine’s 1999 Accounting Law, financial and consolidated statements prepared under IFRS must follow the national XBRL taxonomy, now formally the single format for submission. Ukraine is joining the growing group of markets where structured reporting is mandatory, from EU banking disclosures to US securities filings. The reform signals Ukraine’s determination to align with international standards, strengthen transparency in capital markets and build investor confidence. By embedding XBRL as the single format, the country is laying the foundations for stronger supervision, enhanced international visibility and closer integration with the global financial system.

Login Home > The Standard > How > Getting Started for Developers Need to work out where to start? Software developers tend to do one of two things when first approaching XBRL. They make an assumption that it’s “just” XML and consequently underestimate the size of the task they have. Or, they get bogged down in the formal specifications and overestimate the size of the task. This page provides some very basic pointers that should help developers understand how to avoid these two common mistakes. Generally, integrate third party software. XBRL deals with a very complex set of problems. It allows the representation of entire financial statements, multi-dimensional financial risk and exposure reports, tightly inter-related disclosure data and infinitely variable reports. In order to do so, the specifications that create the standard are relatively complex. In particular, developers need to understand that the structure and validation of data contained in XBRL instances is subject to multiple layers of machine readable metadata contained in interconnected XBRL schema and linkbase documents. Developers should also understand that every aspect of an XBRL document (data and metadata) are subject to multiple layers of validation. For these reasons, the strong recommendation of the XBRL consortium is that developers coming to use the standard for the first time should integrate third party libraries to deal with XBRL data and metadata (whether producing or consuming that information) rather than attempting to implement the XBRL specifications themselves, from scratch. Of course, this assumes that the developer’s interest is in adding XBRL support onto an existing system, for example, creating an XBRL mapping and export function, or an XBRL import function, or an XBRL analysis capability as part of a larger system. Once developers become familiar with XBRL, then it might very well be sensible to replace or enhance that third party component with a native code base. There are both commercial and open source libraries available today. Explore some of the options in the Tools and Services section. Understanding the very basics. Developers need to understand a few of the basics of XBRL: Concepts, Taxonomies, Values, Contexts, Facts, Instances and Dimensions. Definitions or Metadata The foundation of XBRL is the idea of a concept , which is the definition of a term that needs to be, or might be, disclosed in a particular domain. Profit is a concept that is often disclosed in a business domain. Concepts are made more meaningful with a range of supporting information as well as explicit creation of the relationships between different concepts. Profit is what’s left after Expenses are taken from Income . The concept Profit has a number of labels, for different purposes. For example, it should be displayed as “loss” when there were more expenses than income. Labels in XBRL often  appear in multiple languages. And concepts are defined by — and reference — relevant authoritative standards, rules or legislation. Collections of related concepts are held in an XBRL taxonomy . XBRL taxonomies are the metadata framework against which information can be reported. Major accounting and risk domains are modelled as XBRL taxonomies, including IFRS , US GAAP , Chinese GAAP , Japanese GAAP , and the European Basel III bank reporting framework CRD IV and insurance reporting framework, Solvency II amongst many others. Data From an XBRL perspective, the values reported against this metadata are just that – a value , be it a numeric, monetary, boolean, text value – or occasionally even an encoded value like a picture or a chart. The value 1000 can be associated with the concept Profit . But that value-concept pairing isn’t meaningful unless the data is provided with additional information that provides some context . Who made the profit? What period did that profit relate to? In what currency was the profit reported in? By combining a concept ( profit ) from a taxonomy (say Canadian GAAP) with a value ( 1000 ) and the needed context (Acme Corporation, for the period 1 January 2015 to 31 January 2015 in Canadian Dollars) we arrive at a fact . Collections of facts in XBRL are contained in documents called instances. Instance documents are XBRL based reports about performance, risk, compliance or some other set of logically consistent information that needs to be communicated internally or externally. Individual organisations (public sector, private sector, voluntary sector – anyone that needs to report information) will typically prepare a new instance document every reporting period. Each report ( instance ) will contain different values , (the profit in February will be different to the profit in January) associated with different contexts (ie: at least the dates will change) against concepts that are unlikely to change very often, but will do so from time to time. Acme Corporation might report profit every month, but it might only have to disclose “ restructuring costs ” once every ten years. Dimensions Most XBRL environments also allow organisations to report multiple values against the same concept, for various kinds of repeating values. For example, Acme Corporation might have a different operation in several different Canadian provinces, and multiple stores in each province. XBRL provides dimensions to cater for this kind of tightly related information. Dimensions are an additional kind of metadata, that can be defined in taxonomies and then applied to instances as an additional piece of context . Instances that report dimensionally will have multiple contexts that reference different dimension members, applied to multiple facts . So if Acme has profit to report in Alberta, British Columbia and Ontario, but a loss in Manitoba, it will have 5 different facts to report, a profit value against each of the four provinces, and another, overall profit value for the company as a whole. Dimensions can be rolled up (so that sum of the values in the stores in Alberta contribute to the value for that province). They are a very common aspect of financial and particularly risk reporting. Extensions The last fundamental point to understand is the idea of the XBRL extension . Taxonomies can be extended in order to modify the relationships between existing concepts , or to add new concepts to an existing taxonomy . Extension taxonomies are separate documents that import the base taxonomy and override certain aspects of the original. Acme Corporation might report information about share buy backs that the official Canadian GAAP taxonomy doesn’t provide, so in order to report that information in the way that it appears in the old style printed report, Acme can define that new concept and include it in an extension taxonomy . Done right, extensions provide richer and more informative information about specific reporting arrangements carried out by different organisations. Done wrong they can hinder comparability. Many XBRL reporting environments either don’t allow their use or severely restrict their use. It is fair to say that they are a very powerful two edged sword. XBRL is based on metadata. Your design needs to take this into account. XBRL taxonomies are the fundamental building blocks of XBRL. Building blocks that can and will change over time. Hard coding data mapping or data transformation against taxonomies will result in significant maintenance challenges. Develop mechanisms that allow data sourcing and loading to take account of changing taxonomies, whether you are working on data preparation or data consumption. Always use a test-driven approach. The use of both syntactic and semantic rules are a fundamental part of most regulatory environments. These rules are published and can be automatically executed against draft instance documents before they are filed. Corporate and supply chain environments can (and should) use the same mechanisms to ensure the quality, consistency and interoperability of the data. In addition, the specifications utilise extensive conformance suites that provide pass and fail conditions to check whether or not specific code is dealing with XBRL information correctly. The lesson? Always validate your XBRL documents throughout the process of their preparation. And always validate your XBRL software while it is under development or being integrated into your system. Extremely significant capabilities. Developers should be aware of some of the breadth of capabilities of XBRL. It can: be used to create fixed and extensible reports for a huge range of reporting. be used to create on-the-fly forms based on taxonomies and the table linkbase to collect and validate very complex information. be used to present financial statements and reports with the exact look and feel that the preparer chooses, in HTML, via the iXBRL specification. Inline XBRL or iXBRL provides a straightforward and verifiable way to convert values set out on a web page into facts in a generated XBRL document. be used to develop business logic validation rules as well as entirely new business facts, via the formula linkbase. be used to capture ledger and transaction level data, with links back to relevant reporting concepts for audit purposes, later aggregation, exchange and consolidation of information across disparate systems. These capabilities are enabled by XBRL Global Ledger. Membership saves money and time. XBRL is a powerful and sophisticated framework for digital reporting and more and more accounting, reporting, analytical, audit and supply chain software professionals need to become expert in its use. Developing the requisite levels of knowledge outside the XBRL consortium is harder than doing so within it, where there is a large community of experts that are very happy to help answer questions, provide examples, connections and ideas. Joining and participating in the XBRL consortium is a straightforward way to rapidly learn, avoid mistakes, avoid reinventing wheels and accelerate development efforts. Not to mention the fact that it opens up the opportunity to help with the ongoing work to simplify the standard.

          "Software developers tend to do one of two things when first approaching XBRL. They make an assumption that it’s “just” XML and consequentlyunderestimatethe size of the task they have. Or, they get bogged down in the formal specifications andoverestimatethe size of the task.",
          "XBRL deals with a very complex set of problems. It allows the representation of entire financial statements, multi-dimensional financial risk and exposure reports, tightly inter-related disclosure data and infinitely variable reports. In order to do so, the specifications that create the standard are relatively complex. In particular, developers need to understand that the structure and validation of data contained in XBRL instances is subject to multiple layers of machine readable metadata contained in interconnected XBRL schema and linkbase documents. Developers should also understand that every aspect of an XBRL document (data and metadata) are subject to multiple layers of validation.",
          "For these reasons, the strong recommendation of the XBRL consortium is that developers coming to use the standard for the first timeshould integrate third party libraries to deal with XBRL data and metadata(whether producing or consuming that information) rather than attempting to implement the XBRL specifications themselves, from scratch. Of course, this assumes that the developer’s interest is in adding XBRL support onto an existing system, for example, creating an XBRL mapping and export function, or an XBRL import function, or an XBRL analysis capability as part of a larger system. Once developers become familiar with XBRL, then it might very well be sensible to replace or enhance that third party component with a native code base.",
          "Developers need to understand a few of the basics of XBRL: Concepts, Taxonomies, Values, Contexts, Facts, Instances and Dimensions.",
          "The foundation of XBRL is the idea of aconcept, which is the definition of a term that needs to be, or might be, disclosed in a particular domain.Profitis aconceptthat is often disclosed in a business domain.",
          "Conceptsare made more meaningful with a range of supporting information as well as explicit creation of the relationships between different concepts.Profitis what’s left afterExpensesare taken fromIncome. TheconceptProfithas a number of labels, for different purposes. For example, it should be displayed as “loss” when there were more expenses than income. Labels in XBRL often  appear in multiple languages.Andconceptsare defined by — and reference — relevant authoritative standards, rules or legislation.",
          "Collections of related concepts are held in an XBRLtaxonomy. XBRL taxonomies are the metadata framework against which information can be reported. Major accounting and risk domains are modelled as XBRL taxonomies, includingIFRS,US GAAP,Chinese GAAP,Japanese GAAP, and the European Basel III bank reporting frameworkCRD IVand insurance reporting framework,Solvency IIamongst many others.",
          "From an XBRL perspective, the values reported against this metadata are just that – avalue, be it a numeric, monetary, boolean, text value – or occasionally even an encoded value like a picture or a chart. Thevalue1000can be associated with theconceptProfit.",
          "By combining aconcept(profit) from ataxonomy(say Canadian GAAP) with avalue(1000) and the neededcontext(Acme Corporation, for the period 1 January 2015 to 31 January 2015 in Canadian Dollars) we arrive at afact. Collections offactsin XBRL are contained in documents calledinstances. Instancedocuments are XBRL based reports about performance, risk, compliance or some other set of logically consistent information that needs to be communicated internally or externally.",
          "Most XBRL environments also allow organisations to report multiple values against the same concept, for various kinds of repeating values. For example, Acme Corporation might have a different operation in several different Canadian provinces, and multiple stores in each province. XBRL providesdimensionsto cater for this kind of tightly related information.Dimensionsare an additional kind of metadata, that can be defined intaxonomiesand then applied toinstancesas an additional piece ofcontext.Instancesthat report dimensionally will have multiplecontextsthat reference differentdimensionmembers, applied to multiplefacts. So if Acme hasprofitto report in Alberta, British Columbia and Ontario, but a loss in Manitoba, it will have 5 differentfactsto report, aprofitvalueagainst each of the four provinces, and another, overallprofitvaluefor the company as a whole. Dimensions can be rolled up (so that sum of the values in the stores in Alberta contribute to the value for that province). They are a very common aspect of financial and particularly risk reporting.",
          "The last fundamental point to understand is the idea of the XBRLextension.",
          "Taxonomiescan be extended in order to modify the relationships between existingconcepts, or to add newconceptsto an existingtaxonomy.Extension taxonomiesare separate documents that import the basetaxonomyand override certain aspects of the original. Acme Corporation might report information about share buy backs that the official Canadian GAAPtaxonomydoesn’t provide, so in order to report that information in the way that it appears in the old style printed report, Acme can define that newconceptand include it in anextension taxonomy. Done right,extensionsprovide richer and more informative information about specific reporting arrangements carried out by different organisations. Done wrong they can hinder comparability. Many XBRL reporting environments either don’t allow their use or severely restrict their use. It is fair to say that they are a very powerful two edged sword.",
          "XBRL is based on metadata. Your design needs to take this into account.",
          "XBRL taxonomies are the fundamental building blocks of XBRL. Building blocks that can and will change over time. Hard coding data mapping or data transformation against taxonomies will result in significant maintenance challenges. Develop mechanisms that allow data sourcing and loading to take account of changing taxonomies, whether you are working on data preparation or data consumption.",
          "In addition, the specifications utilise extensive conformance suites that provide pass and fail conditions to check whether or not specific code is dealing with XBRL information correctly.",
          "The lesson? Always validate your XBRL documents throughout the process of their preparation. And always validate your XBRL software while it is under development or being integrated into your system.",
          "Developers should be aware of some of the breadth of capabilities of XBRL.",
          "XBRL is a powerful and sophisticated framework for digital reporting and more and more accounting, reporting, analytical, audit and supply chain software professionals need to become expert in its use. Developing the requisite levels of knowledge outside the XBRL consortium is harder than doing so within it, where there is a large community of experts that are very happy to help answer questions, provide examples, connections and ideas. Joining and participating in the XBRL consortium is a straightforward way to rapidly learn, avoid mistakes, avoid reinventing wheels and accelerate development efforts. Not to mention the fact that it opens up the opportunity to help with the ongoing work to simplify the standard.

Writing on the Supervision Blog, Sharon Donnery of the Supervisory Board explained how reforms are making supervision more focused, efficient, and risk-based. At the centre of this drive is a major overhaul of the Supervisory Review and Evaluation Process (SREP). By adopting a multi-year approach tailored to each bank’s risk profile, the ECB aims to sharpen supervisory focus while reducing duplication for both banks and supervisors. Clearer, shorter SREP decisions and faster communication are already in place, with further refinements to capital requirements methodologies expected from 2026. Technology also underpins this shift, with new IT platforms and analytics improving efficiency, cutting administrative burdens, and strengthening risk detection. The ECB is coupling these changes with a cultural push, encouraging supervisors to concentrate on what matters most and aligning activities to the evolving risk landscape. For XBRL based digital reporting, this emphasis on simplification without weakening standards echoes a familiar theme: data should be accessible, proportionate, and high-quality, but never at the cost of reliability.

Key People are Members of the Board when representing the organisation, as well as “Staff”. For the purposes of this policy, Staff includes all employees and contractors. 1. Personal and Professional Integrity XII values respect, fairness, accountability and integrity. All Key People must act, and be perceived to act, with honesty, integrity and openness whenever they represent XII, and they must maintain high ethical standards. In general, representations of XII will contain information that is available to the general public. Key people should take care not to represent themselves as having any type of exclusive connection or information which results in personal or commercial gain. All goodwill resulting from representations of XBRL or XBRL International by key people should flow through to XII. 2. Legal Compliance Key People must comply with all applicable laws. 3. Nondiscrimination XII recognizes the right of all persons to equal opportunity. Key People shall not discriminate against or treat any person they deal with unequally because of race, religious belief, ethnicity, national origin, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, disability, age, marital status, or any other status protected by applicable laws. This policy of non-discrimination also applies to all employment matters. XBRL International firmly intends that all of its activities, including meetings, events and interactions with stakeholders right around the world will not only be conducted in accordance with law but be open, welcoming and inclusive. Key People shall always seek the active involvement of all persons they are working or meeting with and neither positively discriminate, nor discriminate by act of omission. Diversity of thought is a key strength in standards development and adoption activities and Key People should ensure that all views are sought and given careful consideration in furtherance of a positive objective to capture diverse views and perspectives. 4. Anti-Harassment Harassment by Key People will not be tolerated in any form, including but not limited to harassment based on race, religious belief, ethnicity, national origin, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, disability, age, marital status, or any other status protected by applicable laws. Key People must promptly report any instances of harassment that they witness involving other Key People, either to the CEO or the Chair. Harassment is unwelcome hostile or intimidating behaviour and includes: Speech, actions or writing that intimidates or disparages based on attributes set out in this section. Any sexually aggressive speech or behaviour, including intimidation, stalking, displaying sexual imagery or materials. Unwelcome sexual attention or advances or physical contact. Unwelcome comments regarding a person’s lifestyle choices and practices. Abusive, offensive, or degrading language or imagery. Bullying, including any language, behaviour or imagery that encourages, glorifies, incites, or calls for violence, emotional, or physical harm against an individual or a group of people. Sustained disruption of talks, meetings or other events. Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behaviour. Key People should also consider local societal customs of the hosting country when deciding what conduct is appropriate for a business environment. XII will promptly investigate all reports of harassment. 5. Confidentiality and Proprietary Information Key People will routinely access or create certain information (in written or electronic form, or communicated orally) that has been created, developed or disclosed with expectations of confidential treatment. Examples of such confidential information include certain XII Board discussions, strategy plans, financial data, contracts, and team information, as well as confidential materials shared with an expectation of confidential treatment provided by regulators, government and international agencies, software vendors and other commercial and non-commercial organisations. Key People both during and after their connection with XII, are expected to protect all such confidential and proprietary information, to keep it in strictest confidence, only use it for the fulfilment of their obligations related to XII, and not disclose it to unauthorised third parties. This obligation is covered more fully for Staff in relevant employment and contractor documentation. 6. Social Media and Media If Key People are required to use social media as part of their duties on behalf of XII, they must seek prior approval for such communications from the CEO or the CEO’s delegate. Key People are responsible for what they personally communicate over direct message channels in social media and should remember that what they write in those channels might be made public, even if they initially intend for the communication to be private. Key People are encouraged to support the mission of XII by expanding the reach and exposure of XBRL to their audiences on social media. With that in mind, Key People will use good judgment about what they post and remember that anything they say can reflect on XII, even with the inclusion of a disclaimer. Key People must strive to be accurate in their communications about XII and remember that their statements have the potential to result in liability for themselves or XII. XII encourages professionalism, respect and honesty in social media and all other communications. Staff may be required to use their personal social media accounts to support the mission of XII. Staff will take care to ensure that activity on a social media account used for business purposes generally reflects the spirit of this document. Key People and Staff must make clear, by using a plainly stated disclaimer, if they are providing a personal opinion which relates to XII’s activities but does not reflect the mission of XII. Key people and staff members should not represent themselves as an office holder at XII in the media, social media or at events, when a reasonable observer would believe that are in fact acting in a commercial capacity. For example, a Board Member that is also a consultant must not use their XII role to promote an event in which they are selling their own services. Key People that are approached for comment about XII’s views for publication, including in any social media or news outlet, should discuss the inquiry with the CEO and not respond without written approval. 7. Gifts XII’s integrity, accountability and reputation can be compromised if Key People accept (or receive) personal gifts from certain types of outside parties as a result of their role within XII. The types of parties include vendors, potential vendors, members, government representatives, or any other outside individual or organization relating to XII business (collectively, “business partners”). A “gift” refers to the transfer of any item of value including goods and services without compensation, including travel (e.g. flights and hotel rooms to attend a social or sporting event). The exchange of gifts of ‘nominal value’ (less than 100.00 USD) is acceptable as long as it is in accordance with generally accepted, local customs, traditions and laws, the gifts are not offered or accepted with the purpose of influencing a business decision or official action, the gift will not negatively affect the reputation of XII, and it complies with applicable laws. Key People should always seek to obtain approval from the CEO, Chair or Treasurer prior to accepting any gifts above the nominal value (except as explicitly stated below). There will be cultural and business situations in which Key People need to accept a gift above the nominal value set out above in order not to cause offense and other situations in which they will otherwise have questions about the appropriateness of a gift that they might have received. The Key Person should discuss the gift with the CEO, Treasurer or Chair as soon as practicable and account for and document the gift in a suitable register accessible to the Board. Similarly, Key People should clearly account for and document any non-nominal gifts received with pre-approval in a suitable register accessible to the Board. Key People should be aware that: Gifts of cash, cash vouchers, certificates, securities etc with a set negotiable value or other cash equivalents are never acceptable. Frequent gifts from the same party, including those below the 100.00 USD threshold, may be considered improper and a potential conflict of interest. They may not use personal funds to pay for a gift for a business partner in connection with XII activities. The following are examples of allowable gifts: Giving and receiving gifts based on existing personal friendships, as long as they do not obligate, or appear to obligate, either party with regards to any XII activity. Honorarium gifts (e.g. commemorative plaques), that are not cash, given as symbols of appreciation for services provided to the Key Person or to XII, including from other Key People, as long as they do not obligate, or appear to obligate, either party with regards to any XII activity. Gifts of nominal value given during the holiday season or other special occasions, which represent expressions of friendship. Reasonable business meals, such as breakfast, lunch, or dinner, the value of which may exceed the nominal threshold described above without requiring specific approval, provided the nature of the business meal is appropriate. XII may always accept, on behalf of a Key Person, reasonable business-related expense re-imbursement or pre-payment, including flights, incidental travel, accommodation, food and beverages whenever a Key Person is speaking or representing XII at a conference, meeting, working group or similar activity where XII supports the involvement of the Key Person in that event but would not otherwise provide budget for the necessary travel. 8. Anti-Bribery and Corruption (ABC) Policy & Procedures XII is committed to conducting its business ethically in every country in which it does business. This includes compliance with anti-bribery and corruption (ABC) laws such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) or UK Bribery Act of 2010. Corruption is any abuse of power for private gain; while bribery is an act of giving money or gift giving that alters the behaviour of the recipient. Although the nature and scope of corruption and bribery may differ from country to country, XII has a strict zero-tolerance policy toward bribery and corruption and strictly prohibits any improper payments in any type of business dealings anywhere in the world. Key People may not offer, promise or give a bribe to anyone, and may not request or agree to accept or take a bribe from anyone. The purpose of a bribe is often to obtain, retain or “facilitate” business, but might also be to influence an act or decision of the person receiving the bribe, induce such person to do or omit any action in violation of his lawful duty, or to induce such person to use his influence to affect an official act or decision. A bribe could involve direct or indirect payment, offer, authorization or promise to pay money or anything of value, offer or receipt of a kickback, loan, fee, commission, reward or other advantage or giving of contributions or donations designed or stipulated to influence actions in the giver’s favour. A facilitation payment is a type of bribe. A common example of a facilitation payment is where a government official is given money or goods to perform (or speed up performance of) an existing duty. Facilitation payments are illegal under laws of many other countries, regardless of their size or frequency and are in all cases strictly against XII policy. No Key Person may willingly or knowingly offer to make, or actually make a facilitation payment, and all Key People should always obtain written pre-approval from the CEO before providing or promising any government official anything of value. As third-party individuals or organisations acting on behalf of or representing XII can expose the organization to liability under ABC laws, Key People must undertake proper due diligence prior to authorizing such conduct and/or contracting with such third parties. If applicable, certain provisions should be included in relevant contracts regarding compliance with ABC laws, particularly in the case where the third party will be dealing with government officials. XII’s reputation is its main currency. Key People should be wary of any suspicious information about or behaviour from third parties such as allegations of improper business practices, a reputation for bribes, requests for suspicious payments, disproportionate compensation requests, etc. Association with such suspicious behaviour could severely impact XII’s reputation. Key People should contact the CEO immediately, or a Board Director if the CEO is conflicted, if they believe that an improper payment or other thing of value has been or will be offered, directly or indirectly, by XII or an employee or third party working on its behalf, or if anyone offers them an improper payment or other thing of value. 9. Questions/Concerns The Chair, Treasurer and CEO are always available to discuss any issue or answer any question that Key People and others may have about any aspect of this policy.

The OIM provides new and simpler ways to work with XBRL data. It defines a model that represents the meaning of the standard, without referencing syntax specifics. It then defines multiple and interchangeable formats, which can be added to over time. Right now, we support three different formats. Want to collect huge quantities of granular data? xBRL-CSV lets you do that. Want to make your XBRL data simple to use? xBRL-JSON is the answer. Traditional approach working fine? xBRL-XML is your friend. The OIM does not replace the existing XBRL 2.1 specifications. There are no plans to stop supporting them. Indeed they will continue to be improved in important ways. The OIM is an additional and alternative way to use XBRL data and to think about the standard. The Open Information Model is, amongst other things, the simplest way to understand how the XBRL standard represents reported facts and is a great place to start for developers. What is the OIM? At its heart, the OIM is a description of the semantic information inside an XBRL report. The XBRL 2.1 specification defines a syntax that is tightly connected to XML. The OIM instead defines the semantics of a digital report generally. It then describes the information that any syntax must include in order to accurately represent a digital report. This approach makes it possible to work with XBRL data in multiple formats. There are also features in the XBRL v2.1 specification that aren’t in common use, either because they’ve been replaced by alternative approaches, or simply because they didn’t prove to be as useful as anticipated. The OIM leaves those behind in order to define a simplified definition of the information in an XBRL report that is independent of any one syntax. The OIM model currently focuses on the data in an XBRL report. In due course, the OIM will also cover the metadata (or taxonomy side) of the standard to simplify interaction with data definitions as well. What does it mean for me? Over time, the OIM will mean quite a lot. New and simpler ways to approach the production, processing, use and analysis of data expressed in XBRL. At first it will provide new ways to represent facts. For example, xBRL-CSV provides a way to capture huge quantities of data in a very compact manner. xBRL-JSON provides a way to present business reporting data in a very web-friendly format, ideal for all kinds of analytic processes and systems. xBRL-XML remains the best way to catch data problems at source. If you are a regulator, regulated company, or data provider, OIM may well first be used as an additional way to capture or publish certain data, whilst not replacing anything you have in place today. Over time, aspects of the OIM specifications may prove too useful to ignore. If you are a vendor or data scientist, now’s the time to start understanding and experimenting with the new way to think about XBRL — the OIM specifications from XBRL International. What does it mean for the XBRL standard? It’s still the XBRL standard, it’s just different ways of looking at and using the same thing. Going forward you can think of XBRL as a standard that defines the way that you can express business reporting of all kinds in a digital manner. It’s the key standard in support of the digital transformation of reporting. The new OIM specification means that your digital transformation is syntax independent. You can express the same things using different formats, choosing whichever is most appropriate for your needs. In fact, it means that the XBRL standard is technology independent. The standard represents all those aspects of reporting that are important. Things like definitions and relationships between concepts. Labels and descriptions. In as many languages as needed. Dimensional structures like geography, business segments and products. Calculations. Data quality rules. Things like strong and custom data types (for example: dates, time, currency, shares, measures of energy, distance and area). As technology moves on, the OIM means that the standard will move with it. It means that you can represent your reporting in a wide range of different formats, while getting the same information across. All backed by extensive conformance suites that provide the basis of provably interoperable software. A digital reporting ecosystem. Although a huge amount of work has gone into the OIM already, there is more to do and we’ll be adding information, examples, case studies and tutorials as we go along. We’re excited and we hope you will be too. Specifications XBRL technical specifications can be found on our XBRL Specification sub-site .

Creating digital , unambiguous , accurate and reusable versions of financial statements is one of the core capabilities of the XBRL standard. Flexibility is key Financial statements: are governed by official accounting standards contain specific types of information are influenced by norms and habits within industries are extremely flexible – different organisations can and will have dramatically different reports The last point – flexibility – is what makes creating digital versions of paper financial statements a complex challenge. Accounting standards provide significant choices for accounting professionals. Different companies can report very different things, even if they are peers or competitors. They can aggregate subtotals in different ways. They can disaggregate data in the ways that they choose. They can move individual components of financial statements around. They can introduce entirely unique reporting ideas. All of these choices are governed by the judgement of the accounting team involved. Financial statements are not like forms. Of course, flexibility is not just the domain of financial statements. It is true of almost anything labelled a “report”. Different people present information in different ways. Financial statements and reports are not the same as forms. XBRL allows the creation of both. It’s worth understanding how, and what it means. Extending XBRL Preparing, publishing, exchanging, consuming and analysing financial statements was always a design goal and has been a key capability of XBRL for many years. You can think of an XBRL taxonomy a bit like a tree structure. Or rather, a template for a tree. It is a representative view of the way a financial statement might look. However, in the forest, no two trees are the same. XBRL taxonomies can be altered by the organisation preparing their report so that the digital version is an exact representation of the older style paper report. There are a range of changes that can be made to the provided template to take account of the specific reporting decisions of that organisation. These are called extension taxonomies. For example Company A might use a unique reporting term. They can publish an extension to capture that idea. The extension is added to the original tree template, and then the numbers and text that need to be associated with each tag are filled in. Company B might move where a concept appears in the tree structure. Company C might disclose certain information about each of it’s divisions. In order to do so, the company can create what are termed “Dimensions” that duplicate part of the tree structure, once for each of the different dimensions. Using these extension mechanisms (usually a combination of them) it is possible to create XBRL reports that are exact representations of financial statements. Comparability and Extensions Extensions are very powerful, but that they can also present a range of problems. Typically used by securities regulators in order to allow the exact presentation of financial statements as prepared, many other types of implementation don’t require their use. The key reason for this is to do with comparability. Financial statements are flexible, but they are not, by their nature, comparable. Each organisation creates their disclosures in a way that provides what represents, in their view, a “true and fair view” of their financial circumstances. Comparing paper financial statements is a difficult exercise, and XBRL versions of the data make things somewhat simpler. But where companies have disclosed information which might be comparable in different ways, XBRL can’t provide a “magic bullet”. Some regulators have avoided this problem altogether, by requiring regulated firms to provide only the information that conforms to the official taxonomies, and do not encourage extensions. Agencies can provide a fixed format or template that must be filled in wherever relevant (either as a form or via a system-to-system XBRL message). Others reach a similar conclusion – maximising the comparability of filings, and discouraging extensions through the use of Inline XBRL, normally shortened to iXBRL. iXBRL allows the creation of a full financial statement with the “look and feel” that the preparer desires, and only those concepts identified as mandatory or important being marked up. The iXBRL document is a web page that can be automatically and consistently converted into an XBRL document for consumption by a relevant system. Some allow extensions in only limited circumstances. Still others look to the growing market of sophisticated analytics that is growing up around XBRL to deal with the question of comparability and allow extensions to flourish. To take away As well as complex forms, XBRL allows the creation, publication and exchange of entire financial statements. Different environments provide differing levels of flexibility in this area, depending on their requirements and specific situation.

Login Home > The Standard > How > Getting Started for Business Companies that are obliged to file regulatory returns are increasingly required to do so in XBRL or iXBRL format. What do people charged with this responsibility need to know ? What are the different ways that compliant XBRL documents can be created? We answer some of those questions here. What are the different approaches to preparing XBRL documents? There are a wide variety of different approaches to XBRL document creation, depending somewhat on the type of report that needs to be prepared, the systems being used to create the non-XBRL version of that document, as well as the preferences or requirements of the recipient and users of the information contained in the report. Broadly, there are at least 5 different approaches that may be relevant. Forms based approach offered by regulator or third party. In-house embedded production from existing software. Outsourced production. In-house production with “bolt on” tools and processes. In-house embedded production with Disclosure Management or Regulatory Filing software and changed processes. Approach 1. Forms offered by regulator or third party Description Some regulators provide a template or form based approach to filing compliance, using XBRL to control quality, not always making it clear that XBRL is being used. Sometimes specialised software is distributed to regulated firms. Sometimes the forms are available on the web.In order to use this mechanism, filing companies need to login to the system by providing appropriate authentication and then rekey or cut and paste the required information into the form. The system will typically run a range of validation rules over the data and reject areas that appear to be in error. Once corrected and completed the filing is submitted. Pros The advantage of regulator provided forms and templates is the relative simplicity and relative low cost imposed on the preparing regulated company. These kinds of mechanisms are often offered to smaller and simpler companies, as well as in the initial stages of a regulator’s data collection project, in order to simplify the implementation process for the regulator and regulated firm alike. Cons Regulator supplied forms, even spreadsheet-based forms, inevitably require rekeying and copy-paste manual effort, which is time consuming , costly and error prone . Depending on the information being provided, this approach can create risk for regulated companies and they often consider alternative system-to-system mechanisms instead.  In these kinds of environments, regulators can limit the errors with comprehensive error checking and limit the respondent burden by keeping the forms simple. The process is a good starting point, but it is desirable to incorporate a system-to-system option in order to enhance the accuracy and timeliness, while keeping costs down. Approach 2. Embedded production with existing software Description Documents including: Financial statements, tax filings, certain statistical filings; and a range of risk reports in smaller companies with relatively straightforward operations are often created with common off the shelf (“COTS”) software. Accounts production and tax preparation software are good examples. In environments in which the regulator has moved from legacy paper, PDF or proprietary filing arrangements to XBRL and where these kinds of systems are already in use, existing software vendors will usually update their systems to incorporate XBRL tagging. This might be in either a completely automated or a semi-automated manner. This means that XBRL documents and reports that need to be filed with the regulator can continue to be prepared, with only minimal changes to existing processes required. Typically the change obliges the preparer to be aware of (and pass!) the relevant data quality tests that the regulator imposes. Pros The advantage of embedded XBRL production with existing or COTS software is that minimal process change is required and minimal (or zero) costs are incurred by the preparer company and/or their service providers, such as accounting professionals. For some companies that need to comply with new XBRL based filing requirements and that historically have relied on very manual processes, moving to this kind of solution is cheap, simple and low risk . Cons The main disadvantage of this approach is that it is only relevant to relatively simple kinds of operations. If the process of gathering together the information required to prepare the regulatory report is manual, or spread across multiple systems without an automated consolidation mechanism, these kinds of solutions are unlikely to work. These kinds of tools are sometimes inflexible, meaning that some of the other advantages of shifting from a paper-paradigm to a data-paradigm in terms of performance and risk reporting are unavailable. Approach 3. Outsourcing Description Many businesses find that outsourcing their XBRL filing responsibilities to be the best approach for them. This typically involves quite close collaboration with a third party expert that works to tag the relevant report in XBRL. In some environments, this process is made more sophisticated through collaboration tools of one sort or another, which allow the regulated company to carry out some of the work themselves, review the work carried out, or in other ways oversight the work of the outsourced service provider. These kinds of approaches are sometimes a transitional measure, at the beginning of a new regulatory arrangement. Sometimes they work on a permanent basis. Typically outsourcing makes sense in environments in which introducing process change would be difficult or risky. Pros The advantage of outsourcing is that it significantly reduces the work involved in preparing XBRL versions of a report, often at an already busy time. Depending on the kinds of reports involved, (especially if they are relatively straightforward) this can be a cost effective solution. In some environments outsourcing provides or is perceived to provide a “risk insulation” mechanism, separating the officers of the company from the regulator to some degree. For small operations with complex reports, outsourcing is often the only realistic way to prepare their XBRL documents. Cons The disadvantage of outsourcing the preparation of XBRL versions of a report include questions of risk , accuracy and timeliness, as well as variable costs involved. Approach 4. In house “bolt on” tools. Description Companies with relatively sophisticated reporting requirements and processes that are difficult, impractical or costly to change, often turn to so-called “bolt on” tools . These tools range from desktop to SaaS offerings that allow the creation of an XBRL document, often from a combination of Word® and Excel® documents that have been prepared via other means. They are called “bolt on” solutions as they allow the regulated company to continue with an existing process that aggregates, consolidates and otherwise sources the information needed for the regulatory filing using traditional means. The new software is “bolted on” as a new additional step in the process of preparing the report.Some bolt on tools require significant XBRL knowledge and judgement in selecting tags. Others require very little, depending on what is being reported. Companies utilise these tools in order to ensure that they have full control over the process of regulatory reporting. Pros Bolt on tools allow companies to implement XBRL filing with significant control, while retaining existing report preparation processes and technologies. Some provide very significant levels of automation . Others are more complex but provide greater control . Cons Use of these tools means that there is an additional step to add into an existing process, negatively impacting  timelines and sometimes introducing new kinds errors . By their nature, bolt on tools create an XBRL version of a report, based on a legacy format. This can introduce new risks.  The use of these tools often requires moderate or significant knowledge of XBRL syntax and conventions. Approach 5. Embedded “Disclosure Management” and “Regulatory Filing” tools Description Disclosure Management and new generation Regulatory Filing tools take a different approach to the creation of XBRL documents, embedding the process of tagging into the creation of the report and managing the “Last Mile” of report preparation, review, amendment, audit and approvals via a number of collaboration techniques.Some of these tools are truly embedded systems, linking via database connections to corporate reporting and consolidation systems, ensuring the consistency and automating their production. Others instead seek to replace or enhance existing Excel® and Word® based processes with collaboration mechanisms and XBRL-based controls. Some tools are in-house. Others are SaaS based. Most are tailored for specific markets and filing frameworks. Some are something of a hybrid offering, including outsourced assistance with XBRL knowledge and tagging. Pros The advantage of these systems is that they can significantly reduce the time and cost involved and improve the overall quality and reliability of reports being prepared (regardless of XBRL). Cons The disadvantage of these systems is that they are relatively expensive and are therefore mostly attractive to large and complex enterprises. They also require a complete redesign of existing reporting processes – something that can often be considered positive, rather than negative! What is Validation and why is it so important? XBRL uses the idea of formal “validation” or error checking as a fundamental part of the process of producing, reviewing and publishing or filing data. Some validation is quite low level, or “syntactic” and is used to ensure that information prepared using diverse software is interoperable. Other validation really relates to business rules, or business logic. For example a rule that states that “ the balance sheet must balance ” is a piece of business logic. XBRL validation is generally (although not always) published by the regulator, as part of the “taxonomy” or definitions used by XBRL-capable reporting software. Companies that have to report in XBRL should familiarise themselves with the validation rules that their regulator or agency that they are filing to publish and ensure that they run the rules prior to filing their data. Training and certification Some XBRL Jurisdictions, including XBRL US, XBRL Netherlands and XBRL Japan have developed training and/or certification programs that provide tailored education and certification specific to the regulatory framework in those countries. This training should be considered an important part of a company’s preparation in dealing with, or improving their XBRL readiness. Introductory, web-based training and certification is available through a course developed in close co-operation with XBRL International. Classroom style training is available from a large number of providers , consultants and vendors. While much of this training is high quality it is not currently endorsed by or approved by XBRL International.

          "in smaller companies with relatively straightforward operations are often created with common off the shelf (“COTS”) software.Accounts production and tax preparationsoftware are good examples.

Account Credentials Intellectual Property and Standards Making IPR and XBRL Specifications Generally So why Participate? Limitation of Liability A Word about Trademarks Resources Normative and legal documentation Where to Get Help Hello! Thank you for becoming a volunteer in one or more of XBRL International's (\"XII\" for short) working groups (\"WG\" for short), task forces (\"TF\" for short) or advisory boards. This document is intended to provide an introduction to the way that standards are developed within XII, some of the reasons why they work that way, and some of the issues that you need to consider as a volunteer in this capacity. Your role is important! The XBRL standard is now relied on for high quality structured data design, collection and analysis by the majority of the world's leading bank, insurance and securities regulators, an increasing number of business registrars, tax authorities and a small but growing number of enterprises. This means that these standards are a vital part of the infrastructure used to make decisions about individual companies as well as entire national and regional financial systems. It means that the standards are used by hundreds of software vendors and tens of millions of companies right around the world. To contribute effectively as a volunteer it is important that you know how standards are developed within XBRL International and how IP rights impact everyone involved. This document provides an overview of the process and policies, as well as links to other materials that should help you find additional details. Bear in mind that our policies and procedures are enhanced over time so keep an eye out for changes that impact your role and might replace content from this version in this document which was published in April 2020. The Fine Print Please note that this Welcome Pack is an introduction to XBRL International and references a range of processes, policies and rules. It is not intended to be authoritative (or in standards-making jargon - \"normative\"). Please see the specific policies, process documents, charters and rules that are linked throughout this document to understand them in full. Background The \"XBRL consortium\" is comprised of XBRL International, our Jurisdictions and regional affiliations (such as XBRL Europe) and our members 1 . All of our worldwide member organisations have joined because they support the ongoing development and management of the XBRL standard. They are both from the public and private sectors, with a wealth of backgrounds and huge collective expertise. One of the key ways our members support the XBRL standard is by putting forward their staff as volunteers (and sometimes dedicated contractors) to collaborate on the ongoing technical and guidance work associated with the XBRL standard. Membership is vital, but volunteer work is essential. That's you - a new, or existing volunteer - that has stepped forward to assist with the standard in different ways, bringing a diverse and extensive set of experiences and expertise to bear. That diversity is one of the strengths of the standard and one of the reasons that understanding the process for creating and improving the standard is so important. XBRL specifications, other technical products and best practices publications are all developed in accordance with a set of predefined processes that help ensure that they are created in a manner that maximises consensus, fairness, public accountability and quality. Different work products have different processes, usually for good reasons. Our processes have been designed over many years, based on what works, based on a range of criteria that help ensure the best outcome that we can manage, and based on best-of-breed processes drawn from leading standards setting organisations from around the world. One of the key issues that impacts standards development of all kinds is the contribution and management of a range of innovations from different volunteers, and any relevant intellectual property rights associated with those contributions.\nThank you, for being a volunteer, for contributing to the way that business reporting works in a digital world and for collaborating with your peers from around the globe. Please use this guide in ways that work best for you. Keep it handy - and bear in mind that on occasion our processes themselves are improved and updated. Participating in the XBRL International Community Tips on getting the most out of being a volunteer Working as a volunteer is an opportunity to influence XBRL standards and guidance. The contributions of volunteers, combined with ideas developed within the group become our specifications and recommended best practice. Volunteers in almost any capacity will have the chance to both develop and showcase their expertise, learnings and experience and to contribute towards the international standards and guidance development efforts. Figure 1 Volunteers are recognised in the published work product, which includes a list of people who contributed to its development, along with their organisational affiliations. This enhances professional credentials. It is also an opportunity for employer organisations to promote their staff contributions to global standards. Being a volunteer helps you to stay up to date with developments before the work is in the public domain, and you will also be part of the global community which may - and likely will - provide you with valuable networking opportunities. Tips on Collaboration Etiquette XBRL International working groups have volunteers from across the globe collaborating virtually. Here are a few handy tips on collaboration etiquette: You are encouraged to be punctual on calls and proactively notify about any absence in advance. You should also be respectful of the fact that participants join from different time zones and not all of them are native English speakers. Try to complete any task volunteered within the agreed time frame, or report back to the group otherwise. You don't have to agree with other participants every time, but be appreciative of different perspectives. Be mindful of the fact that participants are devoting their time and effort as volunteers. Courtesy and strong listening skills (together with practical drafting work) tend to be what garners respect. The mailing lists are to be used for communicating with the WG and TF instead of individual participant mail addresses. While calls are vital, significant work is done asynchronously within mailing lists, gitlab and other collaboration tools. Drafting and review of drafting away from calls is often the very best type of contribution. Tips on Gaining Recognition as a Volunteer To make your presence count as a volunteer, here are a few useful tips: Draft and/or review the technical work product/guidance documents. Test the draft technical specification and guidance through implementation in software products, proofs of concept (POCs) and/or XBRL taxonomies and reports. This is critical for identifying deployment issues and fine tuning work product. Participate actively in the discussions, bring your perspective and insights to the table. It's absolutely fine to participate in the mailing list rather than speaking up on the call. Your WG colleagues appreciate the time and the rigour that you put into that process. Some of our most productive volunteers over the years have been non-native English speakers that take the time to analyse new proposals and ideas away from the calls. Share information (as long as it isn't confidential) on how programmes or taxonomies have implemented aspects of the XBRL standard, this helps the group to understand real world examples and improve them. Attend the calls regularly to understand the context of discussions. Contribute to discussions on the mailing list. Socialise the published work products to help them reach a wider audience and garner feedback. Figure 2 \"Leaving Your Hat at the Door\"- Independence in Standards Setting The XII work products have world-wide applicability and impact numerous regulatory reporting systems, software products and preparers. This makes it imperative to have a fair process and exercise independence while contributing to the standards. Volunteers, while contributing to XII product development, are expected to act in the best interest of the standards and not act in a manner detrimental or contrary to the interests of the standards. The goal during standards development is to build consensus and arrive at the right solution without the influence of personal or employer agendas. The XII process allows the termination of members engaging in any conduct contrary to the interests of the organisation. XBRL International Governance The overall governance of XBRL International is shown in Figure 3 Figure 3: Governance Structures XBRL International is ultimately governed by its Member Assembly, a group of voting Members. The Board develops long-term growth & sustainable strategies and oversees the activities of XBRL International. The XBRL Standards Board (XSB) is responsible for managing the production of the consortium’s technical materials. The Best Practices Board (BPB) is responsible for managing the production of the consortium’s guidance materials and other best practice work products. The XBRL International staff work with the Board, XSB, BPB and their respective working groups, task forces and committees to support the day to day operations of XII. Refer to the governance details page for a detailed explanation on the governance structure and XSB & BPB working groups. The Standards Development Process Technical specifications hugely impact software products, implementations and reporting entities around the world, so it is imperative to have a transparent and robust specification development process. Each specification goes through a maturity cycle; a simplified process of the specification development is shown in Figure 4. The specification advancing to the next stage in the maturity cycle is not a linear progression, there are multiple checkpoints to ensure the specification meets quality requirements at every stage. Figure 4: Specification Development Process Each stage of specification publication is approved by the XSB and, at the Recommendation stage, additionally approved by the BoD. Apart from the technical specifications the working groups also develop supporting documents such as conformance suites, overview documents and primers. These are often released concurrently with the specs. You can browse the XBRL standards on the specification subsite . Refer to the specification development page for a detailed explanation. Why Standards Making Takes Time A common question from a range of stakeholders is \"Why does the creation of standards take so long\"? Creating technical specifications that work across the globe, for millions of different organisations, is a complex exercise. If XBRL International changes an existing specification it doesn't impact a single piece of software and the people that rely on that software, it impacts hundreds of pieces of software and subsequently all of the users of those tools. Like other leading standards setters, XBRL International relies on Test Driven Development techniques and formally provable specifications. Depending on the work at hand, it will be accompanied by a conformance suite made up of dozens, hundreds, or even thousands of small tests that provide an objective way to ensure interoperability and that the specifications work as advertised. This can be a long and involved effort and can take some time. Of course, the more experts that work in this field (within reason) the more that can be done. So your contributions, wherever they come from and whatever your background, are truly welcome. The Guidance Development Process Guidance refers to best practices, explanatory guides, case studies and white papers to aid the implementation of the XBRL Standard in a reporting programme/framework. Guidance generally is targeted at XBRL data collectors, taxonomy architects, authors and XBRL report preparers, unlike the technical specification which is mainly for the software developers. The guidance publication goes through multiple checkpoints as shown in Figure 5, to ensure the guidance is technically correct and fit for implementation. Each stage of specification publication is approved by the BPB. Figure 5: Guidance Development Process You can access all published guidance on the guidance section of the website . Refer to the guidance development page for a detailed explanation. Working Group and Task Force Meetings The WG and TF meetings are scheduled in advance. The chairs or staff liaison for the group circulates the meeting agenda on the group's mailing list. The minutes record all decisions of the group and are distributed to the mailing list. The meeting members are required to review the minutes and propose edits if needed. Decision Making and Voting inside XII Groups Group discussions seek to reach consensus amongst the members. Building consensus is to ensure opinions, ideas and concerns of members are taken into consideration and that decisions reached are supported by members. Voting is used to formalise decisions. The voting requirements vary depending on the nature of the business, for example voting on XII work product requires a proper majority (more than 50% of voting members), whereas revision of a WG or TF charter requires a supermajority (at least 2/3 (two thirds) of the Voting Members) Voting rights and attendance The category of working group membership determines voting rights and attendance requirements. Voting members: Voting members can vote on decisions regarding the work products. There are attendance requirements for voting members which can be found in the process documents for the XSB and BPB. Non Voting members: Non-Voting Members can participate and contribute without being concerned about attendance, however, cannot vote on the work products. Observer: A rare participant category, who can attend calls but cannot speak or post to the group's mailing list without the Chair's permission. There are no attendance or participation requirements observers. Working group membership rights and attendance requirements are summarised in the Table 1: Table 1: WG members voting rights and attendance Activities Voting Members Non-Voting Members Observers Can attend WG calls ✔ ✔ ✔ Can contribute to discussions and post to the mailing list ✔ ✔ Vote on XII work product ✔ Attendance requirements applicable ✔ When Can E-Votes be used and when shouldn't they? Voting on business discussed in the WG can happen at the meeting or can be conducted electronically. Electronic voting (e-votes) is used when all voting members cannot be present at the WG meeting. Electronic vote (e-votes) can be initiated if the WG resolves that the item can be decided using e-votes. Generally e-votes, once initiated, are conducted over seven days. Account Credentials As a WG member, you get access to the relevant file repository and other content of the group. Table 2 lists the credentials required for accessing XII content: Table 2: Account Credentials XII Content XII Website Account BOX Credential Registered Email xbrl.org member-only content ✔ Specification file repository and bug tracking (GitLab) ✔ Working Groups  Mailing List ✔ Collaborative Workspace (BOX) ✔ Member Communication (if opted in) ✔ Intellectual Property and Standards Making The process of developing and distributing standards of any kind is an exercise in pooling the talents and knowledge of a range of people from different organisations and different backgrounds, generally to innovate, but certainly to expand the understanding of all those utilising the eventual standard. Like any aspect of the knowledge economy, standard setting involves Intellectual Property Rights (or \"IPR\"). There are a range of formal IPRs that are relevant, including patents, design rights, trademarks and copyright as well as some informal ones (especially secrecy and lead generation) which tend to be less relevant in standards making, as by their nature, they are confined to the organisations that possess them. When making standards the goal is to provide a range of capabilities that can normally be freely licensed and utilised. That is, standards should generally be available to all, without licensing costs. Within XBRL International this is a particular focus. In order to achieve this, care needs to be taken throughout the standards making process, that third party IPRs are not infringed, so that nothing in the specifications is dependent on the use of IP owned by someone other than the standards development organisation. This requires care in standards making planning, process and in particular, the management of contributions. In a variety of industries there are numerous examples of patent holders seeking to restrict, or tax, the ability of others to use standards that have been developed by relevant experts. Very few have succeeded, but that doesn't mean that anyone (including volunteers) can be complacent about IPRs as they work to create standards and specifications. IPR and XBRL Specifications Generally XBRL International has put significant time, effort and money into the development of policies and procedures associated with the development of its specifications. Some of the more visible aspects of this are the requirements associated with becoming a volunteer through the Working Group Enrolment process. Volunteers and their employers must agree to the XBRL International IP Rights Policy. The policy sets out the obligations of the volunteer and her/his employer in relation to the contribution of IP, the (limited) situation in which those contributions can be withdrawn, and the situations in which \"Necessary\" IP that might form part of a specification, but that have been contributed by a volunteer/member organisation, must be licensed. In practice, to date, in the event that either there has been IP contributed that is subject to a patent, or a non-member, non-contributor owned patent or other IPR has been discovered, XBRL International has chosen to seek a different technical approach that does not require the incorporation of that IPR. Note that there is not an obligation to either: Search for or discover the existence of third-party patents or other IPRs Contribute IP that might solve a specific technical issue, while being a volunteer. Nor is XBRL International obliged to utilise either FRAND (fair reasonable and non-discriminatory) licensing arrangements or \"Non-assertion\" approaches to the incorporation of contributed IP. Indeed, it has been XII's goal to avoid the incorporation of third-party IP at all. So why Participate? In practice, to date, the vast majority of XBRL International specifications development has been highly innovative, and collaborative - in other words, our volunteers have created new technical approaches together, and contributed that work in support of the Standard as a public good. Our volunteers find that there are significant benefits to their work within XII Working Groups, typically in terms of extending their own expertise, developing a network of contacts within industry, helping to expand market opportunities, provide knowledge infrastructure that supports the delivery of technology and services and, frequently, encourages other proprietary innovation based on deep understanding of the common standards that underpin digital business reporting. The standards (and the standards making process) often act as a catalyst for innovation. Limitation of Liability XBRL specification recommendations are offered without warranty, and this clause is extended to all contributors of XII's work product. All information provided by members to WGs and TFs are without warranties and to the maximum extent possible under law members do not have liability toward any implementer or third party for any damages arising from the use of specification recommendation or any work product. A Word about Trademarks Volunteers working within XII should generally also understand the XBRL International trademark policy. It protects XBRL International, its Jurisdictions and Regional affiliations, and its members in controlling the manner in which XII's various word marks and registered design marks are used. Generally speaking, be aware that XII does not permit third parties to use its design marks in a commercial context, except specially designated versions of those designs. Use of the word mark \"XBRL\" in brand names etc, is restricted to members if it has been approved by XII.\nSee more at the XBRL International trademark policy itself. Resources Key Resources You Need to Know About GitLab Gitlab - is an open-source DevOps platform used to manage the development and maintenance of our technical specifications. GitLab provides mechanisms for individual members of WGs to propose changes to specifications and for those changes to be voted on (a \"Merge Request\") by others. It provides full versioning, meaning that is is possible to identify individual contributions, and importantly, it is also where a range of automated tests are applied to various work products. Volunteers working on specifications should make themselves familiar with the operation of GitLab. BOX BOX is the document sharing service currently used by XBRL International working groups. Access to the folders is based on the working group enrolments. Learn more about effectively using BOX in this Box Pro Tips guide. GoToMeeting Most of the working group meetings are currently held on the \"GoToMeeting\" platform. The agenda for the working group meeting includes a link for joining the meeting and the phone dial-in numbers (if required). GoToMeeting allows audio participation via the internet, which has a number of advantages.\n\nWG and TF Members are strongly urged to avoid using built-in computer speakers and microphones as the call quality for all participants quickly degrades.\n\nPlease use a good quality USB connected headset instead. Brands like Plantronics Blackline wired headsets have been used to good effect by many participants and are relatively inexpensive.\n\nOther tips: If and when you are sharing your screen, it is often best to just share the application that you are interacting with, rather than your entire desktop. Always use the mute button on the GoToMeeting system when not speaking to avoid introducing unnecessary background noise. For more information refer to the GotoMeeting Attendee Guide . We are aware that the GoToMeeting system does not always work everywhere, including in some countries with limitations on the use of VOIP technologies, locations with limited bandwidth and behind some corporate firewalls. We try to ensure that there are always dial-in numbers to use as a good alternative. MeetUpCall Some group meetings may be organised using \"MeetUpCall\" infrastructure. MeetUpCall allows audio participation via phone (local numbers dial-up) and screen share via internet.\n\nThe participants receive a meeting invitation mail with personalised dial-up instructions. The invitation mail provides a \"One tap smartphone join\" option, link to view/initiate screen share and view the call dashboard.\n\nIf MeetupCall cannot be accessed in the participant's country we ensure alternative arrangements are available. MarkDown Markdown is a lightweight plain-text-formatting syntax. The markdown conversion helps to produce a consistent publishing HTML format across the documents. Technical specifications are drafted and edited in markdown. Guidance documents are typically drafted and reviewed in a word processor. The approved version of a guidance document is transformed to markdown.\n\nThe key elements of markdown variation adopted at XII are described in XBRL Markdown Syntax document . There is also a cheat sheet that might be helpful. Normative and legal documentation This Welcome Pack gives an overview of XBRL International's policies and procedures and serves as a quick reference guide. This document does not form part of XBRL International's legal documentation.\n\nLearn more about legal and organisational documents that guide XBRL International ​available at the ​ \"Governing Documents\" section of our website. Where to Get Help A volunteer new to the WG may initially find the policies and procedures overwhelming. Fret not, help is at hand.\nVolunteers can approach the Chair of the group, who should be able to assist with most queries. Volunteers are equally welcome to connect with XII staff, we would be delighted to help. Notice that this is \"members\", lowercase, which is a colloquial use of the term. Strictly speaking, XBRL International has \"Members\" (upper case), which can be Direct Members (as well as Sustaining Partners) or Jurisdictions. Jurisdictions, which are recognised as the official national body for the consortium in a specific country, themselves have members. These \"members of Members\" (ie: Jurisdictions' members) are termed \"Participants\" in XBRL International's bylaws. All of this is relevant when we hold elections. The rest of the time we just refer to all of these organisations as \"members\". ↩ Get Involved Best Practices Board XBRL Standards Board Nominations Committee Groups Navigating Your Journey as a Volunteer Governance – Overview The Standards Development Process -Overview The Guidance Development Process – Overview Individual Certification Subscribe to the Newsletter!

The XBRL International Software Certification Programme allows compliant software to obtain and display an annual accreditation confirming its conformance to the XBRL specifications.  By selecting XBRL Certified Software, users can be confident that the software has been tested using the comprehensive conformance suites that XBRL International uses to ensure interoperability between XBRL software products. Certified software can be identified by the XBRL Certified Software ™ logo, and by use of the XBRL Certified Software trademark. In order to verify the authenticity of the software, valid uses of the logo link to a “certificate page” on the XBRL Certified Software website . This page confirms the full details of the tests conducted and shows whether the certification for the software application in question is still up-to-date. Software vendors seeking to gain certification of their software are invited to have their software tested. The current list of XBRL Certified Software products can be found on the XBRL International website here . What does XBRL Software Certification mean for users? XBRL is a modular standard, comprised of a number of technical specifications.  These specifications prescribe the behaviour required of any software that creates or consumes XBRL reports. Strict adherence to these specifications is critical for ensuring interoperability of the standard, that is, ensuring that an XBRL report created in one piece of software can reliably be consumed by any other conformant XBRL software.  Ensuring that software complies with every aspect of the specifications is a difficult and time consuming task.  In order to make this easier for software developers, XBRL International provides automated test suites, known as conformance suites, that can be used to test software.  By selecting XBRL Certified Software, users can have confidence that the software has been tested for compliance with the specifications using these conformance suites. For the preparers of XBRL Reports, this gives confidence that reports will be accepted and correctly understood by consumers including regulators. For regulators looking to accept XBRL reports from filers, validating reports using XBRL Certified Software will ensure that all valid reports are accepted whilst ensuring that problematic, non-conformant reports are caught early, avoiding the costs associated with investigating and resolving data quality issues. Once the initial testing has been completed, conformance claims can be verified by referring to the product’s certificate page on the software.xbrl.org site.  This records details of when the software was tested, and what specification modules it supports, allowing you to select software that meets your needs. What does XBRL Software certification mean for software providers? As global XBRL adoption increases, so does the XBRL software market, and with it a growing variation in the quality of products claiming to support XBRL. Developing quality software is expensive and time consuming, and it can be difficult to demonstrate the results of this effort.  Fortunately, the XBRL International Software Certification Programme provides an objective, independent and verifiable international recognition of your software’s conformance with the XBRL specifications, enabling you to differentiate your company and its products from lower quality implementations. Once your software has been certified, we will provide you with a dedicated certificate page on the XBRL Certified Software website , recording the details of your product’s certification including the date of the most recent test and the specification modules tested.  You will also be granted the right to use the XBRL Certified Software logo and trademark in connection with your product during the period that the certification is in force. Obtaining certification for your product The XBRL Software Certification Programme is open and is accepting applications. Discounted fees are available to members of XBRL International.  In order to obtain certification, software providers will need to demonstrate their software correctly executing the XBRL conformance suites, and allow XBRL staff to further test the software by providing additional test cases.  Certification  is granted for a period of one year, and re-assessed annually.

XBRL International is the umbrella body for the standard around the world and is the organisation charged with the development and maintenance of the XBRL specifications that make up the standard. Funded by membership fees, as well as through revenue brought in through training, certification and events, it was founded in 2001, following incubation of the standard within a special committee of the AICPA. With more than 600 organisational members from more than 35 countries, and with 23 formal Jurisdictions established around the world, XBRL is in use in most of the world’s major economies and is rapidly being embraced across the rest of the globe. Structure XBRL International is a US s501 (c) 6 not-for-profit organisation, with a small distributed staff. Their work is supported by a significant number of expert volunteers that, together with the staff, work to develop, maintain, test and extend the technical specifications, and work to define and constrain relevant guidance material. XBRL International also works to extend adoption around the world, including through education, training and events. Governance and Membership XBRL International has two classes of members: Jurisdictions , which are independent supporting organisations designated as the official representative of XBRL International in specific countries. Members of Jurisdictions are termed “participants” and have rights to contribute to and access member materials at an international level. Direct Members , which are members that join XBRL International directly, because they operate across borders and want to contribute at a worldwide level, or operate in countries that don’t have a local jurisdiction. Together, XBRL International members operate as a “Member Assembly” which is a governance and oversight body that has a number of reserved powers. Members elect candidates to the XBRL International Board of Directors , which is the governing body of the organisation, providing strategic, compliance and governance direction to the CEO and staff. Standards Making XBRL International publishes standards in the form of specifications, that define business reporting technologies in use by regulators and regulated companies, governments, businesses of all sizes and within large and medium sized enterprises. The development of these specifications follow a process designed to promote consensus, fairness, public accountability and quality. During this process, the document will be published at various draft statuses for public review and comment. The end of the process is publication as a Recommendation, a stable specification which is considered suitable for broad adoption and implementation. Oversight of the standard making process is managed by an independent group of technical experts, the XBRL Standards Board , which works through a number of standing and project-based working groups to review, develop, test and manage the consortium’s specifications. Intellectual Property XBRL Specifications , once they reach Recommendation level are open and freely licensed subject only to a requirement that they may not be modified. Interoperability In order to ensure straightforward software interoperability, significant effort is made in developing and managing conformance suite tests for all material parts of the XBRL specifications. Software vendors should ensure that their XBRL modules pass all relevant conformance suite tests. Why Get Involved? Taking part in consortium activities is a great way to build a global network of peers, improve your technical, management or project skills, get involved in important and interesting work outside your usual responsibilities and raise your profile in the business reporting industry.

XBRL is supported by a strong software development community that has create a broad range of XBRL products, both free and commercial, covering the needs of both end users and developers. In general, the best way to get started with XBRL is to use an existing product. You can find out more about existing products in our Tools and Services directory. For a very general technical introduction read the Getting Started for Developers page. Want all the technical details? The XBRL Standard is made up of a number of technical specifications. A complete index of these specifications can be found on our specification sub-site, specifications.xbrl.org . The foundation of the XBRL Standard is the XBRL 2.1 specification , which is tightly integrated with the XBRL Dimensions specification. These specifications let you define XBRL taxonomies and create XBRL instances, including multidimensional data . Other key modular specifications provide additional capabilities: Inline XBRL (or iXBRL) specification provides a way to publish reports in HTML with embedded instructions to convert the information on the page into XBRL. Table Linkbase provides a way of displaying (and collecting) complex data in human readable forms and templates. The Formula specification provides a way to define and run business logic rules against data contained in an instance document, to either test that information or to create new facts. The XBRL Global Ledger taxonomy is a framework for dealing with, exchanging, compiling and aggregating transactional data with full drill down capabilities. The Versioning specification provides a way to document that changes that are made to taxonomies over time. The Streaming specification lets you deal with very large quantities of data. A range of supporting specifications simplify aspects of the framework, or provide registries to simplify certain kinds of transforms or data types. Too much?

AI is an extraordinarily important new technology, but it is not a magic wand. As the CSRD negotiations enter their last stages, some MEPs are wondering whether AI can replace digital reporting. The answer is ‘no’, but it is its natural complement. As the EU seeks to encourage […] Read more News Item AI India MSCI XBRL International XBRL means faster, cheaper analysis of sustainability disclosures, but few are ready to take advantage By Editor Sustainability reporting is at a crossroads. Countries around the world are adopting sustainability and climate reporting standards, but most of that information is trapped in PDFs. That means slower, more expensive analysis, and a missed opportunity to harness the full power of growing volumes of sustainability data. Read more News Item AI iTNews Asia XBRL Data first, AI second: why the smartest companies start with structure By Editor AI might grab the spotlight, but data runs the show. Without structure, even the most advanced models are guessing rather than learning. Canon’s Norihiro (Nick) Katagiri made that point clearly in a recent iTNews Asia interview, reminding businesses that successful AI depends on solid, well-organised data from the start. Read more News Item AI AI agent IFRS From digital to intelligent reporting with AI and XBRL By Editor Dr Maria Mora, Head of Innovation & Digital Strategy at Fujitsu Spain and a member of XBRL International’s Board of Directors, offered a compelling takeaway from this week’s IFRS Taxonomy Consultative Group (ITCG) meeting in London: the era of intelligent reporting is here, and XBRL is its foundation. Read more News Item AI Taxonomy Seed funding for AI projects to convert PDFs into XBRL By Editor SRC Digital Insurance Services has launched a research initiative to explore whether artificial intelligence can reliably convert US Department of Transportation (DOT) “Application for Payment” PDF reports into XBRL data. Read more News Item AI CHAT BOT EDGAR SEC Structured data analysis – with a simple conversation? By Editor One of the big possibilities we’ve been talking about as the AI revolution unfolds is the prospect of interacting with XBRL data – and getting accurate, decision-useful insights – using AI chatbots, without the need for in-depth technical analytics skills. That future is already here. Read more News Item AI Claude J&J XBRL US Structured power: AI backs XBRL for energy data By Editor Following their recent experiment with Johnson & Johnson’s financials, XBRL US has taken their AI testing into the energy sector, asking whether structured data improves how large language models handle public utility filings. Read more News Item AI AI+XBRLseries XBRL US Supercharging AI with structured data By Editor Artificial intelligence is very good at producing answers. The problem is, without structured data, it often doesn’t know if those answers are right. Read more News Item AI CSRD EFRAG ESAP EFRAG portal offers glimpse into ESRS disclosures By Editor EFRAG has launched its “State of Play 2025” portal, offering an interactive and data-rich look at the first wave of sustainability reporting under the European Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS), mandated by the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD). Read more News Item AI Blog MCP AI is making expensive mistakes with business data. Here’s a fix By Editor Too many AI tools analysing company financials are working with messy PDFs and unstructured text, leading to hallucinations and errors that could cost millions. Meanwhile, there’s a goldmine of clean, structured financial data sitting in XBRL filings that AI systems have (too often) been ignoring.

An introduction to XBRL GL for accounting professionals. Login Home > The Standard > What > XBRL Global Ledger: Transactional Reporting Accountings systems store transactional details in data stores called ledgers. These records, in turn, consolidate, eliminate and aggregate data up into reports . Generally this involves the loss of relevant supporting details. XBRL GL is the standard in the XBRL family that allows this information to be retained and controlled. Summary reports lose their connection to supporting details. XBRL is mostly used to allow the unambiguous transfer of aggregate performance information, from place to place and organisation to organisation. From company to regulator. From government agency to central government agency. From subsidiary to headquarters. From supplier to customer. All at a summary level, suitable for making many decisions. Summary data is often all you need. But what if you want to drill down to the detail ? XBRL Global Ledger or “XBRL GL” provides that capability. Electronic accounting and ERP systems work at a transactional level by storing a range of information about each individual entry in a specialised ledger, which, in turn, is summarised into a general ledger. The data in the general ledger are themselves summarised in order to provide reports. In doing so, especially if the information is moved from its originating system, much or all of the details of each original transaction become unavailable . XBRL Global Ledger: the open standard for transactional reporting To get around this problem, you need a standard way to capture, archive, transmit and aggregate all of the information contained in the original ledgers, as well as what’s in the general ledger, journal entries etc. You need a standardised way to store all of the operational data and data definitions contained in an accounting or ERP system. XBRL GL is designed to do just that. XBRL GL can: assist and automate audit review of accounting ledgers, facilitate data consolidation in a mixed (or heterogeneous) environment, provide detailed reporting in situations where that’s needed; and facilitate transfer of transactional accounting data from system to system. XBRL GL (“Global Ledger” not “General Ledger” so as to indicate that any transactional information can be dealt with) provides a generic and system-independent way to record all of the details in any kind of ledger. XBRL GL allows those transactions to be aggregated or rolled up for a wide variety of reporting purposes, while retaining the ability to drill back down to the detail. Because the connections between counter-parties and products can be retained, XBRL GL can also be used to manage eliminations between related accounts. The potential cost savings and enhanced knowledge that XBRL GL can provide are significant. While XBRL GL has been part of the XBRL standard for a long time, in many ways it is only coming into its own now that so called “big data” technologies that can aggregate very large quantities of disparate information have become available.

If you’re listed on a regulated market in the EEA, your prudential data is no longer a PDF that gathers dust. It has to be tagged, structured and submitted into the European Banking Authority’s new Pillar 3 Data Hub. The aim is efficiency. Regulators can automate oversight, investors can benchmark with confidence, and banks can avoid the endless duplication of reporting the same figures in slightly different forms. Yet behind the tidy vision lies plenty of work. Data tagging, systems integration and training staff in the taxonomies are all part of the change process. More institutions are next in line. With CRR3 extending the mandate to smaller and less complex banks from later this year, XBRL continues as the lingua franca across Europe’s banking sector. And it is not just finance. ESG disclosures and other regulatory streams have also been joining the XBRL based machine-readable club. Banks that treat this new stream of XBRL reporting as a compliance headache will struggle. Those that embed it into their systems stand to cut costs, improve data quality and perhaps even get a head start in the race toward automated, standardised reporting. Read more about it here .

Countries around the world are adopting sustainability and climate reporting standards, but most of that information is trapped in PDFs. That means slower, more expensive analysis, and a missed opportunity to harness the full power of growing volumes of sustainability data. A new analysis from the MSCI Sustainability Institute (with a little help from XBRL International) reveals that while few countries are currently preparing for digital sustainability reporting, a handful of trailblazers are showing what’s possible when sustainability disclosures leverage XBRL from the outset. India is ahead of the curve, as the only country currently to have mandated digital sustainability reporting. In the research, the Institute used Indian BRSR (Business Responsibility and Sustainability Reporting) disclosures to pit XBRL against AI, testing how efficiently they could pull data from reports. They found that, after initial set-up, using python scripts to extract data from XBRL reports was up to 10 times faster than parsing unstructured PDFs using AI-based natural-language processing. XBRL offered a faster route to actionable insights, with significantly greater accuracy. Those are impressive efficiency advantages for XBRL – but of course, XBRL and AI are not necessarily rivals. In fact, they can be complementary tools. Some of the most powerful future approaches to understanding sustainability performance will likely involve a combination of the two, with structured data providing the solid foundation for reliable and efficient AI-driven analysis (see below in this newsletter for more). XBRL powers up reporting, yet troublingly, few are ready to reap the benefits in the sustainability arena. A review of more than 30 jurisdictions shows a clear global mismatch between the rollout of sustainability reporting regulations and digital reporting capabilities. Interestingly, many of the most active implementers are not established digital success stories but emerging markets. Their experience offers valuable lessons: the importance of ongoing improvement and adjustment, of communication and education, and the need to build a digital mindset. To truly unlock the power of sustainability data for performance insights and investment decision-making, more countries need to follow the lead of early adopters like India. Digital reporting is an essential part of ensuring that disclosures are timely, comparable, and actionable. Read more here .

The well-attended meeting concluded with strong consensus that Bangladesh must move towards structured, machine-readable reporting to strengthen investor confidence and regulatory oversight. The Commission confirmed that an iXBRL Taxonomy Committee will be established to adapt International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) for local use. A phased implementation is planned, with an initial pilot of dual filing (PDF and iXBRL) with the country’s top 15 to 20 listed companies, expanding to the top 100 companies and mutual funds, and finally extending to banks, insurers, and brokers in partnership with their regulators. Ultimately, BSEC aims to build a national digital reporting platform, effectively a Bangladeshi EDGAR or EDINET, to enable cross-agency data sharing and transparency. Commissioner MD Saifuddin, CFA underlined the ambition: “This is not about one regulator or one professional body — it is about building an ecosystem for the country. The project must be forward-looking, not regressive, and the benefits will cut across all stakeholders.” Currently, most corporate reports in Bangladesh are filed as static PDFs or spreadsheets, making analysis difficult and duplicative. This marks an important moment for Bangladesh. As the Commissioner observes, by embracing iXBRL the country can leapfrog into global best practice, strengthen its capital markets, and create a trusted financial ecosystem for the future. At XBRL International, we see Bangladesh building solid foundation for success, for example in its commitment to a carefully phased approach and to collaboration and communication among stakeholders.

Login Home > The Standard > What > What is XBRL? XBRL is the global standard that powers digital reporting. By making business reporting computer-readable, it helps make business data easy to find, access and analyse. Why do we need it? Because just publishing corporate data in any format is not enough. To meet the needs of users, today’s disclosures must be available in a consistent, comparable and computer-readable form. Business reports prepared in XBRL are fully digital, so they can be understood and analysed by computer software. This makes analysis easier, faster, and more accurate, helping users draw meaningful comparisons about business performance. XBRL makes it easy to compare information in multiple languages and from different countries, can enable automated analyses across many thousands of reports, and provides high-quality input for AI models. XBRL can connect companies directly with data users , providing verified information for precise analysis. It also increases the speed and accuracy with which intermediaries such as data providers can consume information and offer insights. It makes the reporting process more efficient, and ultimately ensures that the information reaching end users is decision-useful. Where does the XBRL standard come from? The XBRL specifications are developed and maintained by XBRL International, bringing together expert volunteers from around the world. XBRL International is a global-not-for-profit member consortium, committed to improving reporting in the public interest. Read more about the consortium and join our global community here . A universal standard for unique reports XBRL is a freely licensed, open standard available to all. XBRL works like a single, universal alphabet and grammar for digital reporting. It makes it possible to capture business concepts in a standard, digital form. Standards-setters and regulators use this alphabet and grammar to create words and build dictionaries (or ‘ taxonomies ’), defining exactly the information they need. Each set of reporting rules has its own dictionary, reflecting a specific reporting ‘vocabulary’. These standardised dictionaries empower organisations to craft corporate reports that both tell a unique story and speak a common digital language , ensuring consistency and comparability across the business landscape. Read more about how the standard works here . XBRL offers almost limitless possibilities. It is a flexible framework that can be applied to any type of business data , including financial statements, sustainability disclosures, prudential reporting, tax returns, and a wide range of other innovative applications. Using XBRL, business data can be exchanged easily and accurately across different software tools. XBRL is designed to be independent of platform: there is a thriving ecosystem of software that supports XBRL and meets the needs of different users. All XBRL Certified Software is fully interoperable. XBRL is currently in use in 65 countries worldwide, in almost 220 diverse reporting implementations – a number that is growing all the time. With millions of XBRL reports published every year, users worldwide rely on XBRL for high-value data, across different languages and in many different types of reports. What does XBRL do? The key to an XBRL report is that each fact is digitally “tagged” so that it can be recognised by computer software, and efficiently extracted and analysed by users anywhere. It is easy to add multilingual labels to each fact, allowing automatic language switching by software users and helping data cross language barriers. The XBRL standard also incorporates data validation capabilities, helping ensure the high quality of reports. Digital reporting works a bit like barcodes . The barcode on a can of tomatoes means it can be accurately identified in seconds, from factory to warehouse to supermarket. A quick scan tells any worker not only that the can contains tomatoes rather than beans, but also its brand, price and other important details. In the same way, XBRL tags travel with each fact wherever it goes. Business information travels through reporting chains, between multiple organisations, with perfect accuracy. XBRL plays a huge role in increasing corporate transparency, reducing information asymmetries, and improving the efficiency of capital markets . When digital reporting – supplying clear, consistent digital meanings – is combined with rigorous management oversight and assurance processes, users can have a high degree of confidence in business data and in the insights they draw from it. For investors, finding information, comparing corporate performance and uncovering new opportunities all becomes easier, cheaper, faster and more accurate. XBRL data can open up wider possibilities for investment, less limited by language and location. Regulators too benefit from streamlined data collection, improved understanding of market, sustainability or other risks, and ultimately more efficient and effective oversight . Corporates , meanwhile, are able to tell their own stories . Digital reporting can open up increased access to capital , potentially at a reduced cost. For companies with an eye on the future, getting to grips with XBRL offers the opportunity to go beyond compliance , for example in monitoring and benchmarking performance. XBRL brings reporting into the digital age, and offers powerful capabilities across the reporting chain. Market demand for reliable digital data is high: for users from investors to regulators, XBRL is the gold standard for decision-useful analysis .

It makes reporting digital, and so makes data useful. XBRL provides a flexible framework for almost any kind of digital reporting. It is used in diverse reporting requirements, for all types of data, enabling business information to flow around the world. XBRL: the alphabet and grammar XBRL is like a single, universal alphabet and grammar for digital reporting. It’s a freely licensed, open international standard available to all. In technical terms, this alphabet and grammar – the XBRL standard – is made up of a set of specifications. The specifications are developed and maintained by XBRL International, a global-not-for-profit operating in the public interest, together with expert volunteers from all over the world. Software engineers use these specifications in products such as commercial XBRL software and regulatory data collection portals, ensuring that XBRL data is comparable, interoperable and accurate. Taxonomies: the dictionaries The basic alphabet and grammar can be built up into words with a diverse range of meanings. These words can be collected into shared dictionaries, with the distinctive vocabularies different communities need. In our analogy, the words are reporting concepts. The dictionaries are different XBRL taxonomies. Taxonomies provide authoritative digital definitions for reporting concepts. Taxonomies are usually created and maintained by national and international standards setters and regulators, or other organisations that need to collect information. They are a way to capture a set of reporting rules in standard digital form, ensuring that everyone reporting digitally under those rules does so in a consistent way. The concepts being defined in a taxonomy, and the business data being reported, can be of any type. XBRL is the gold standard for financial, sustainability reporting and prudential reporting, and is also used for tax returns, energy utility data, commercial property values, municipal reporting, and a host of other cutting-edge applications. Reports: the stories Now that our language has an alphabet, grammar, words and dictionaries, we’re ready to tell an infinite variety of unique stories. These stories are digital corporate reports, meeting diverse reporting requirements around the world and potentially capturing any aspect of business activity. Companies use the XBRL specifications and taxonomies to produce digital reports, either via specialised software or through simple templates provided by regulators. Management is able to tell the story of company performance directly to users, and users get that data in an accurate, consistent and comparable way – ultimately making it decision-useful. XBRL data flows readily along the information value chain from companies to regulators to analysts and investors. Because the information is digital, it can easily be discovered and analysed with software. It also provides high-quality input for AI models, eliminating AI guesswork and enabling deeper insights. XBRL is currently in use in almost 220 reporting mandates and voluntary implementations in 65 countries – a number that is growing rapidly as corporate reporting continues to evolve. How and what: a note on standards! XBRL is the international digital reporting standard – and a comprehensive set of tools – for how to report business information. It does not prescribe what information should be reported, and indeed can be applied to almost any kind of business data. There is sometimes cause for confusion, since we also talk about reporting standards to mean the requirements determined by standards setters on what information can be reported – for example, the international IFRS Accounting Standards, the European Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS), or Japanese GAAP. These rules about what should be reported are captured in a standard digital form in shared XBRL taxonomies, which define concepts such as profit or emissions in digital terms. We strongly encourage the growing tendency for standards setters to take a digital-first approach, whereby they consider how data will be reported at the same time as they develop requirements about what to report, and build in XBRL definitions from the start.

          "How the XBRL standard works",
          "XBRL is the global standard for business data exchange. It makes reporting digital, and so makes data useful.",
          "XBRL provides a flexible framework for almost any kind of digital reporting. It is used in diverse reporting requirements, for all types of data, enabling business information to flow around the world.",
          "XBRL: the alphabet and grammar",
          "XBRL is like a single, universal alphabet and grammar for digital reporting. It’s a freely licensed, open international standard available to all.",
          "In technical terms, this alphabet and grammar – the XBRL standard – is made up of a set of specifications.",
          "The specifications are developed and maintained by XBRL International, a global-not-for-profit operating in the public interest, together with expert volunteers from all over the world. Software engineers use these specifications in products such as commercial XBRL software and regulatory data collection portals, ensuring that XBRL data is comparable, interoperable and accurate.",
          "In our analogy, the words are reporting concepts. The dictionaries are different XBRL taxonomies.",
          "The concepts being defined in a taxonomy, and the business data being reported, can be of any type. XBRL is the gold standard for financial, sustainability reporting and prudential reporting, and is also used for tax returns, energy utility data, commercial property values, municipal reporting, and a host of other cutting-edge applications.",
          "Companies use the XBRL specifications and taxonomies to produce digital reports, either via specialised software or through simple templates provided by regulators. Management is able to tell the story of company performance directly to users, and users get that data in an accurate, consistent and comparable way – ultimately making it decision-useful. XBRL data flows readily along the information value chain from companies to regulators to analysts and investors. Because the information is digital, it can easily be discovered and analysed with software. It also provides high-quality input for AI models, eliminating AI guesswork and enabling deeper insights.",
          "XBRL is currently in use in almost 220 reporting mandates and voluntary implementations in 65 countries – a number that is growing rapidly as corporate reporting continues to evolve.",
          "XBRL is the international digital reporting standard – and a comprehensive set of tools – forhowto report business information. It does not prescribewhatinformation should be reported, and indeed can be applied to almost any kind of business data.",
          "There is sometimes cause for confusion, since we also talk about reporting standards to mean the requirements determined by standards setters onwhatinformation can be reported – for example, the international IFRS Accounting Standards, the European Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS), or Japanese GAAP. These rules aboutwhatshould be reported are captured in a standard digital form in shared XBRL taxonomies, which define concepts such as profit or emissions in digital terms.",
          "We strongly encourage the growing tendency for standards setters to take a digital-first approach, whereby they considerhowdata will be reported at the same time as they develop requirements aboutwhatto report, and build in XBRL definitions from the start.",
          "XBRL technical specifications can be found on ourXBRL Specification sub-site.",
          "Join our Newsletter mailing list tostay plugged in to the latestinformation about XBRL around the world.",

XBRL provides a way to: define unambiguous, reusable definitions report individual facts against those definitions where necessary (and permitted) extend those definitions to take account of unique reporting ideas or aggregations test the resulting report against the constraints set out in the definitions file or publish the finished report consume entire reports or individual facts as needed in a platform independent, vendor neutral way. The standard is supported by a large number of Common Off The Shelf software packages and by a large number of service providers, and is freely licensed open technology, developed and supported by a global, not-for-profit consortium, committed to improving reporting. XBRL provides a number of mechanisms to deal with very complex reporting requirements, including sophisticated multi-dimensional data, complex interrelated forms and individual presentation requirements. Because it is oriented around the idea of formal testing and document proof across the various parts of the information supply chain, XBRL allows regulators and corporate users to improve the quality and consistency of the information they require. High Quality Specifications The XBRL specifications have been developed over more than a decade, are stable, and have been developed through a lengthy process designed to promote consensus, fairness, public accountability and quality. The XBRL International standards support almost every kind of reporting imaginable, are inherently multi-lingual and support large numbers of sophisticated business requirements. There is a lot of detail about different ways that XBRL is used around the world on this site, the technical specifications themselves are freely available, and detailed implementation guidance and technical case studies are available for XBRL International members. The XBRL International consortium is a unique grouping that harnesses the knowledge, determination, innovation and openness of the public and private sectors from around the world. Comprehensive The XBRL family of specifications support a vast array of different kinds of reporting requirements, including: Simple Forms Complex and Multidimensional forms Free format reporting of the sort found in board packs and financial statements The presentation of free format reports the way that the preparer intended The creation of facts and error condition tests based on data contained in forms and reports Transaction reporting that can be aggregated and rolled up into aggregate performance reports Of course, XBRL is not the only way to move information around. Many people coming to XBRL will also look at relevant alternative formats .

In some cases, the use of XBRL can greatly diminish the respondent burden, as accounting and reporting software are able to reuse information already available. In other cases the technology can’t assist at all, and this is purely a policy question. Regulators need to understand the business environment, the software ecosystem, and their regulatory responsibilities in order to make necessary decisions.",
