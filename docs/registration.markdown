## Rules
The rules of the FinAI Contest 2025 aim to ensure fairness, transparency, and ethical conduct while also encouraging contestants to engage in knowledge-sharing and collaboration within the community:

1. Each team should consist of 1 to 4 people and should only register once. Each participant must join one and only one team.
2. Submission files should follow the format of the baseline solution and the requirements.
3. Each team can make multiple submissions to each task during the competition. The most recent submission will be used for final evaluation.
4. Contestants can communicate with the organizers through Discord or email.
5. We embrace the open-source community. At the end of the contest, contestants are encouraged to release their work as open-source.
6. Contestants are expected to adhere to the highest standards of ethical conduct and integrity throughout the contest.
