| ![Xiao-Ying Liu](https://github.com/Open-Finance-Lab/FinRL_Contest_2025/blob/main/docs/assets/organizers/supervisors/liu-xy.png?raw=true) | **Xiao-Yang Liu**, Ph.D., Columbia University, faculty at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. His research interests include deep reinforcement learning, big data, and high-performance computing. He created several open-source projects, such as FinRL, ElegantRL, and FinGPT. He contributed chapters to a textbook on reinforcement learning for cyber-physical systems and a textbook on tensors for data processing. He serves as a PC member for NeurIPS, ICML, ICLR, AAAI, IJCAI, AISTATS, and ICAIF. He also served as a Session Chair for IJCAI 2019. He organized Financial Challenges in Large Language Models (FinLLM)@IJCAI 2024, FinRL Competition at ACM ICAIF 2023, the First/Second Workshop on Quantum Tensor Networks in Machine Learning (QTNML) at NeurIPS 2020/2021, IJCAI 2020 Workshop on Tensor Networks Representations in Machine Learning, and the NeurIPS 2019 Workshop on Machine Learning for Autonomous Driving.|
